i have lost the urban ways.,2
"i see two boats with nets, lying off the shore of paumanok, quite still;",2
"whereto we claim sole title by our toil,",2
"those hours the ancient timepiece told,--",2
"far, far away, o ye",2
as hebe's foot bore nectar round,2
"all right,' says t'other, 'only step round smart;",2
who fishes in the frog-pond still?,2
"still must mine, though bleeding, beat;",0
i can see how you might. but i don't know!,2
which clanged along the mountain's marble brow--,2
if the pure and holy angels,1
early or late? or shall that commonwealth,2
"i strive, i pray.",1
when hills are free from snow,2
"""he!  patron!",2
and the rude people rage with ignorant cries,0
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.,0
"""thou of the god-lent crown,",2
"and the words which he utters, are--worship, or die!",0
"--so they feast in the hall of atli, and that eve is the first of the seven.",1
"but half the secret told,",2
"fooled with your promises,",0
"in a dell mid lawny hills,",2
in nothing is wanting;,2
"yet by experience taught we know how good,",2
"and hoping chink, she talked of morts of luck:",2
"from alton bay to sandwich dome,",2
o'er time's delusive tide.,0
"from the fair brow; she, rising, only said,",2
the beacon-light that forth they held,2
"they were wet, and glistened with raindrops, shed",2
"all autumn pil'd, though spring and autumn here",2
"he bent and kissed her head, warm, shining, soft,",1
"she falls back from the freedom she had hoped.""",2
"and that is why, the lonesome day,",0
"i would don my hose of homespun gray,",2
"the play is done,--the curtain drops,",2
"far out, in peace, the white man's sail",2
"so neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen",2
"""a quick consumption, that no art could cure!",2
snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin,2
"her visions and those we have seen,--",2
"except in france; and when it’s found in france,",2
you heard the news from vincent carrington.,2
did this wood come floating thick,2
"then oer the rushes flies again,",2
wid a song up on de way.,2
"is passed, and our aereal speed suspended.",2
"has it become to thee a labyrinth never ending,",0
wait his returning strength.,2
but because she stept to her star right on through death,3
"from god's design, with threads of rain!",2
"is shorter than a snake's delay,",2
low in supplication bending.,2
accept the gift which i have wrought,2
"some moment, nailed on sorrow's cross,",0
"all hastening onward, yet none seemed to know",2
"but the great spirit plants it in our hearts,",2
"returne, the starres of morn shall see him rise",2
came in slow pomp;--the moving pomp might seem,2
till after-poets only knew,2
"ho! philip, send, for charity, thy mexican pistoles,",2
our wavering apparitions pass,2
with sincerest conviction their chairs to the shore;,1
come up like ocean murmurs. but the scene,2
"moonstruck with love, and this still thames had heard",1
"false-faces hung on strings,",0
"yea, all the world it might be, and all sounds of the earth were stilled",2
"we were content to show,",2
"leading downward to the river,",2
the story of a spavined steed;,2
so runs the perfect cycle of the year.,1
"here on the street as strangers do,",2
"then rose they up around him,",2
at his approaching footsteps.  winter came,2
when waves forget to roll.,2
sent by an hand unseen;,2
she listening sate.,2
the call's more urgent when he journeys slow.,2
"so, then, without a word that might offend",2
the lady eunice such a life she flew,2
"soft, discontented eyes!",0
"even while we gaze, though it awhile avail",2
"and kissed him with a sister's kiss,",2
"and virtue's bright image, enstamped on the mind,",1
"though books on manners are not out of print,",2
"as they were loosened by that hermit old,",2
"first, he mused what the animal substance or herb is",2
"young childhood, with a moisten'd eye,",2
"of sainthood in purple the pattern and pick,",2
the morning and the evening made his day.,2
"with the earls of the goths about her: so queenly did she seem,",1
and to thy brief captivity was brought,2
then he stripped the shirt of wampum,2
"that, following this slight trace,",2
"upon whose boughs were wicker cages hung,",2
"the one good man in the world who knows me, --",1
"god prosper long our noble king,",1
"nor is he, as some sages swear,",2
"""what hope wouldst thou hope, o sigurd, ere we kiss, we twain, and depart?""",3
rejection of his humanness,0
"that moved in the beginning o'er his face,",2
three banks in three degrees the sailors bore;,2
"who had my mother's servant been,",2
"""i mean estelle has always held the purse.""",2
"uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.",1
that by nor sound nor word,2
bird that from the nadir's floor,2
"an echo returned on the cold gray morn,",0
"and full of wonder, full of hope as he.",1
the red sword sealed their vows!,3
"and tender thoughts, and prayers, remains,",1
"sparked a ruby through its heart,",1
the head that lay against your knees,2
can storied urn or animated bust:,2
fu' to ba' de battle's brunt.,2
"daily struggling, though unloved and lonely,",0
"his boundless gulfs and built his shore, thy breath,",2
"how nature to the soul is moored,",2
"to men below,",2
made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet,2
ef zeke had be'n the bigges' man,2
"with peace and soft rapture shall teach life to glow,",1
which goaded him in his distress,0
for the greek must ask elsewhere.,2
nothin' to du but watch my shadder's trace,2
"no rest that throbbing slave may ask,",0
"the sower scatters broad his seed,",2
"apple-blossoms pink, and low",2
"sounded o'er earth and sea its blast of war,",0
in every health we drink.,2
"and so,",2
"(distinctly here the spirit sneezed,)",2
"then--i would gather it, to thee unaware,",2
my winter sports begin.,2
"where the cloudy hangings waver and the flickering shadows fall,",0
"rais’d on the seas, the surges to control—",2
"""sorry?  of course you are, though you compress,",2
lift their blue woods in broken chain,2
and murmured a strange and solemn air;,0
it's a pretty early start.,2
"dead among the shouting people,",0
and never be forgot in mighty rome,1
the pyramids have risen.,2
"sooner, augustine, sooner far, shall i",2
"and _channing_, with his bland, superior look,",3
when lips and heart refuse to part again,2
still is my heart and vacant is my breath--,2
"with its close-curling gold, and love revived.",1
"brightly expressive as the twins of leda,",1
with spring’s delicious trouble in the ground,3
"swifter far than happy night,",1
and what are all the prizes won,2
"let dat cradle swing,",2
"i see them torn by gallic guns,",0
"reasoning to admiration, and with mee",1
"but heaven in thy creation did decree,",2
"behind the sea-wall's rugged length,",2
when our mother nature laughs around;,1
"no, i won't be seein' nobody in the mornin',",2
"precisely, at all events, what he ought not,",2
an' see a hundred hills like islan's,2
back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?,2
"knowing this, that never yet",2
it is but three times thou hast set thine eyes,2
"here comes the cripple jane!""  and by a fountain's side",0
"an old smoaked blanket arches oer his head,",2
"as round some giant hive, all day and night,",2
"and she passed out between the blessed things,",3
less often man--the harder of the two.,2
have roughened in the gales!,2
"then along the river strand,",2
fall again.,2
and so i should be loved and mourned to-night.,3
the likeness of the wood's remembered leaves.,2
a tyrian colony; the people made,2
the beauty and the joy of their renewed might.,1
