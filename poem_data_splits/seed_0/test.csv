"mind us of like repose, since god hath set",2
"already, land! thou hast declared:  'tis done.",1
for suddenly the sweet bells overcame,1
"brightly expressive as the twins of leda,",1
"where holds the soul communion with its god,",2
the climax of those hopes and duties dear,1
three banks in three degrees the sailors bore;,2
whose anvil's even din,2
tis the djinns' wild streaming swarm,2
that in their lives such deadly fray they ne'er had seen before.,0
"dearest, why should i mourn, whimper, and whine, i that have yet to live?",3
"peep timidly from out its nest,",2
you sha' n't roll yo' eyes at me.,0
and willing grow old,2
"take the warm welcome of new friends with thee,",1
which goaded him in his distress,0
that little barley-cake you keep from him,2
"on winter afternoons,",2
"an old smoaked blanket arches oer his head,",2
"let us do our work as well,",2
"then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,",2
"yet both in different colours hide their art,",2
so that ye for them are made,2
godminster chimes,2
"let fall on her a rose-leaf rain of dreams,",1
the life of love that gave it--settles.,1
the crack as of her splitting. did she take,2
was she not somewhat that he could not rule,2
"by a great master of the past,",1
attend your brother to the stygian flood.”,2
beneath thy gracious feet!,1
came in slow pomp;--the moving pomp might seem,2
in just the dress his century wore;,2
"that moved in the beginning o'er his face,",2
to his ears there came a murmur of far seas beneath the wind,2
"flood his black hearthstone till its flames expire,",0
and make the liveliest monkey melancholy.,0
"once upon a time, i lay",2
wait his returning strength.,2
"grander, nobler, than that pilot",1
"they say that 'time assuages,' --",2
"shall yet be glad for him, and he shall bless",1
"an angel had not startled him,",2
"it would be different if more people came,",2
all over the vale below.,2
"the weird pathetic scarlet of day dawning,",0
"the moon hath veiled her face,",2
which clanged along the mountain's marble brow--,2
that wisdom's lips seemed borrowing friendship's heart.,1
how many times we must have met,2
"a man may see the moon so, in a pond,",2
"tell me, the charms that lovers seek",2
"then--i would gather it, to thee unaware,",2
"he says he’s hungry,—he would rather have",2
"the sower scatters broad his seed,",2
(if haply the dark will of fate,0
"you have done this, says one judge; done that, says another;",2
‘received that cheque.’ but you!... i send you funds,2
"then thro’ his breast his fatal sword he sent,",0
"those hours the ancient timepiece told,--",2
how seen? how known? as through your glass,2
"to rise upon some other shore,",2
my daily thoughts perpetual converse held,2
"stood and watched it at the doorway,",2
"that satraps would have shivered at his frown,",0
she sought for flowers,2
"of long-uncoupled bed, and childless eld,",2
"swing, like a ship at anchor, roun' my base,",2
the red sword sealed their vows!,3
"then oer the rushes flies again,",2
"but it is not enough, ah! not enough",2
"moonstruck with love, and this still thames had heard",1
"let those whom nature hath not made for store,",2
"jehovah, jove, or lord!",2
"in the worst of his poems are mines of rich matter,",3
"but, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,",0
until my latest breath.,2
"ho! philip, send, for charity, thy mexican pistoles,",2
wilt thou our lowly beds with tears of pity lave?',0
"and through it, and round it, and over it all",2
"and so on. then a worthless gaud or two,",0
above the myriad roofs and spires rise;,2
"such civil war is in my love and hate,",3
"his bark her anchor weighed,",2
"is passed, and our aereal speed suspended.",2
"he hid his gold,",2
no controversial hebraist was the dame;,2
"lo now, o daughter of kings, let us rise in the face of the day,",1
still is my heart and vacant is my breath--,2
"thus while the trojan prince employs his eyes,",2
"in our embraces we again enfold her,",1
to accomplish suicide.,0
live with heav'ns choicest constant blessings crown'd!,1
the adulterate death of lucrece and her groom.,0
"now betimes on a morning of summer that giuki's daughter arose,",2
points beyond the midnight hour.,2
"lift not your hands in the banded war,",2
rang the beautiful wild chimes,1
each lodger here adorns the walls:,2
that _she_ should walk beside him on the rocks,2
and the rude people rage with ignorant cries,0
"and hold the hours as joshua stayed the sun,--",2
"has it become to thee a labyrinth never ending,",0
"unclasped the rusty belt beneath,",2
henceforth to labor's chivalry,2
"how poor these pallid phrases seem,",0
when hills are free from snow,2
none will forget it till shall fall the deadly dart!,0
"no, i won't be seein' nobody in the mornin',",2
"when on the boughs the purple buds expand,",2
o that i were where helen lies,2
"tells us that the day is ended.""",2
"and tender thoughts, and prayers, remains,",1
"""sir, i have dreamed of you. i pray you, sir,",2
"some thought of me, a last fond prayer",1
and give a meaning to their lives; and still,2
to make a body curse.,0
"and i greet from far the ray,",2
"three lives, three strides, three foot-prints in the sand;",2
he has no calling and he owns no trade.,2
press hard the hostile towers!,0
"our present, our past, our to be,",2
"her visions and those we have seen,--",2
since ferdinand and you begun,2
"these fly to the heavens--their course never ends,",2
"fix’d on the walls with wonder and surprise,",1
glad on its stone-built hearth; and thorough the wide-mouthed smoke-flue,2
"now, if thou art a poet, tell me not",2
"i turned, and saw behind me surge",2
the call's more urgent when he journeys slow.,2
"here comes the cripple jane!""  and by a fountain's side",0
and very venus of a pipe.,2
its temples and its palaces did seem,2
"that you or yours, having an appetite,",2
"from the overhanging branches,",2
"his golden cross worn innermostly, (carved",2
"for penance, by a saintly styrian monk",2
"his days in peace; but his straight lips were bent,",3
"mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled,",0
"and all their echoes, mourn;",0
"on the clear mirror of a loving heart,",1
"and full of wonder, full of hope as he.",1
fearless but weary to thy arms i creep;,3
"leading downward to the river,",2
to intercept the sunshine and your face.,2
"whereto we claim sole title by our toil,",2
"it flows so long as falls the rain,",2
early or late? or shall that commonwealth,2
fall again.,2
"that, following this slight trace,",2
chief poet on the tiber-side,2
"upon whose boughs were wicker cages hung,",2
"thou feel'st it burning, in and in,--and fear",0
"false-faces hung on strings,",0
"when the brow is cold as the marble stone,",0
you heard the news from vincent carrington.,2
"behind the sea-wall's rugged length,",2
"did from the altar steal a smouldering brand,",0
then he stripped the shirt of wampum,2
"how over, though, for even me who knew",2
"from earth, with the waters of pain.",0
"sire, son, and grandson; so the century glides;",2

"god prosper long our noble king,",1
"you didn't stop for fuss,--",2
"sparked a ruby through its heart,",1
on thine own bird the sweet enthusiasm,1
"i see two boats with nets, lying off the shore of paumanok, quite still;",2
"at dusk of eve,",2
"such days as thou, not even thou didst know,",2
through swiftly changing season.,2
both the unseen and the seen;,2
and at my door they cower and die.,0
"with the whole world gone blind,",0

"the king ordains their entrance, and ascends",1
"overleaning, with flickering meaning and sign,",2
"there is nothing to hope for, i am tired,",0

a wail of utter agony,0
"and others say, as we have said:",2
