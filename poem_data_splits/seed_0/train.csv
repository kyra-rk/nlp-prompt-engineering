and yon outlying range invites,2
swifter far than youth's delight--,1
"for her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,",1
"and she said: ""what dost thou, brynhild? what matter dost thou seek?""",2
"o, i can ne'er forget",2
"dauntless he rose, and to the fight return’d;",1
"whether they met on festal eve, in field,",2
who wrote this modest version i suppose,2
me honied paths forsake;,2
the end of the play.,2
the moon and the stars were anxious,0
"well, i guess i looked at that hand",2
"what once has been and ne'er shall be again,",2
and i am still the same;,2
yon creamy lily for their pavilion,2
"""rubadub! rubadub! wake and take the road again,",2
i do not keer a jot;,2
around thy place of slumber glowing!,1
"darling, the merciful father",1
"tain't the words alone, but feelin's,",2
"ef 'twarn't for studyin' evenins, why, i never 'd ha' ben here",2
"that thou should'st smile again?""--the evening came,",2
for that’s his specialty. what creature else,2
their names let hands of horn and tan,2
"the foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,",0
"radiant as moses from the mount, he stood",1
"when thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, thou didst open the kingdom of heaven to all believers.",3
sweet poesy from heaven,1
"weak, timid, homesick, slow to understand",0
"and while before me, spotted with white sails,",2
"and fears are added, and avenging flame.",0
endymion would have passed across the mead,2
the message is not like what i have learned,2
"are angel faces, silent and serene,",1
"forever quivering o'er his task,",0
"but, through the war-cloud, pray to thee",3
around it cling.,2
"lord, remember me!""",2
"what i have heard,",2
despised am i by those who call'd me friend,3
"the china dustless, the keen knife-blades bright,",1
"even hearts estranged would turn once more to me,",3
"he smell de bacon cookin', an' he hyeah de fiah hum;",2
"i look up from this page of thine,",2
"unhitched the breeching from a shaft,",2
waiting the flutter of his homemade fly;,2
"some come ridin' in top-buggies wid de w'eels all painted red,",2
here on the cliff beneath the oleanders,2
