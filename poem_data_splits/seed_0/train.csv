the tribute of this verse.,2
the end of the play.,2
"the oriole in the elm; the noisy jay,",2
"to match your wit against the maker's will,",2
"these are the tales, or new or old,",2
"and country eyes, and quiet faces --",2
"tormented by the quickened blood of roots,",0
"still, upon a flower,",2
"""sir, ye shall find him, if ye follow up",2
"a day's experunce 'd prove to ye, ez easy 'z pull a trigger.",2
"men said, into a smile which guile portended,",0
"leave the garden walls, where blow",2
"like your nest,",2
inexorable death; and claims his right.,0
henceforth to labor's chivalry,2
and not alone by gold;,2
misnames as the dog rosey now.,2
"now rise and look upon me.""  and she rose,",2
and very venus of a pipe.,2
and give a meaning to their lives; and still,2
"there's a certain slant of light,",2
"and say, ‘fie, pale-face! are you english girls",2
and bow to dread inquisitor and worship lords of dust;,0
he who plays with old iagoo,2
"dey kin talk from hyeah to yandah,",2
"flood his black hearthstone till its flames expire,",0
of course throw monstrous shadows: those who think,0
"warped into adamantine fretwork, hung",2
"whom phoebus taught unerring prophecy,",2
and the lure of what is called heaven is little or nothing to me.,3
pillars by madness multiplied;,0
in latmian fountains long ago.,2
"when, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied",0
"the leprous corpse, touched by this spirit tender,",3
"where, all the long and lone daylight,",2
her eye proclaims her of the briton line:,2
to hold it fast.,2
"but de lawd is all aroun' you,",2
"ay, knelt and worshipped on, as love in beauty's bower,",1
"it steam in winter like an ox's breath,",2
above the myriad roofs and spires rise;,2
"each by his fiery torture howl and rave,",0
"here those that in the rapid course delight,",1
"grander, nobler, than that pilot",1
"halcyons of memory,",1
"""the snow that husheth all,",2
is lovely round; a beautiful river there,1
"before the saintly soul, whose human will",1
"at dusk of eve,",2
"his song, though very sweet, was low and faint,",3
"oh, say, is he, the eternal, there?",2
"""i say it's someone passing.""",2
a golden helm his front and head surrounds,2
that passed with you and me.--,2
"but she spake: ""bid hither gunnar, lest the sun sink o'er the bent,",2
the days pass over me,2
"""sir, i have dreamed of you. i pray you, sir,",2
vain cries--throughout the streets thousands pursued,0
yet was this period my time of joy:,1
"in prosperous days. like a dim, waning lamp",3
"forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain",0
"then thro’ his breast his fatal sword he sent,",0
in their archetypes endure.,2
"and thus each tint or shade which falls,",2
her not-nice load.,0
"till they have told their fill, could scarce express",2
thy hands all cunning arts that women prize.,1
"i'm safe enlisted fer the war,",2
"a ruby, and a pearl, or so,",2
sweet hope!,1
"the silence, and the rain.",2
with pale blue berries. in these peaceful shades--,1
the oriole's fledglings fifty times,2
save for a cry that echoes shrill,0
and i've been like that silly girl.,0
and heavy as the dead.,0
"ah! still, methinks, i hear them calling;",2
tis gone past recalling!,2
"miles off, three dangerous miles, is home;",0
all over the vale below.,2
the blessed memory of thy worth,1
"you'll not want business, for we need a lot",2
"gnossian his shafts, and lycian was his bow:",2
"you shall not find the sons of atreus here,",2
"all along down ""injin crik?""",2
for wanderings sad and lone.,0
"augmented, sweet, a hundred fold",1
"counts his nectars -- enters,",2
every day a rich reward will give;,1
nile shall pursue his changeless way:,2
"envy and calumny and hate and pain,",0
"busy, with sacerdotal tailorings",2
"till, fur 'z i know, there aint an inch thet i could lay my han' on,",2
have seen the danger which i dared not look,0
"and what then doth he gather? if we know,",2
let the scared dreamer wake to see,2
when the glance hast lost its beam;,0
i sate down beneath the beech,2
"from the overhanging branches,",2
"love works at the centre,",2
how seen? how known? as through your glass,2
"and changing like a poet's rhymes,",2
"to rise upon some other shore,",2
thy mission to a world of woe.,0
troubling with life the waters of the world.,0
"you didn't stop for fuss,--",2
so prythee get thee gone.,2
who god possesseth,2
"three lives, three strides, three foot-prints in the sand;",2
with level wings swinging,2
"seed-field of simpler manners, braver truth,",1
and to the tender heart and brave,1
"""as the gods would i see,"" said sigurd, ""though death light up the land.""",3
"and then, to go to sleep;",2
"when i peruse the conquered fame of heroes, and the victories of mighty generals, i do not envy the generals,",3
"from his own tripod, and his holy tree;",2
so that my stern resolve was almost gone.,2
me up like that.  'essence de la valliere'--,2
"ez though i wanted to enlist 'em,",2
"then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:",2
with sharp turns weaving,2
"already, land! thou hast declared:  'tis done.",1
many changes have been run,2
"as if we guessed what hers have been,",2
"our saxon tongue has known,--",2
"let us do our work as well,",2
for vessels moulded by a mortal hand?,2
"in town, an' not the leanest runt",0
"thou wovest dreams of joy and fear,",3
if men are always at a loss,0
"deaf, and dumb, and blind, and cold,",0
"first feels the gathering head of steam,",2
"tinkle, tinkle, sweetly it sung to us,",1
and call that brilliant flower the painted cup.,1
playmates' glad symphony.,1
"on her changed world of ruin, waste and wrack,",0
they had not set there. who had set it there?,2
"would my heart and life flow onward, deathward, through this dream of",3
"then he said ""amarant""; and the damsel drew",2
who felt your own thought worthy of record,1
"in every health we drink, my boys,",2
"through the salt sea foam,",2
but descend to the ocean again.,2
"he scarce had ended, when those two approachd",2
"we’ll say instead, the inconsequent creature, man,—",2
"we're a band!"" said the weary big dragoon.",2
to intercept the sunshine and your face.,2
faint voices lifted shrill with pain,0
and yet perhaps you had been startled less,2
"with dews of tropic morning wet,",2
"i left the place with all my might, --",2
"from the slaughtering of my offspring, and the spoiling of my land;",0
with such vehement force and might,0
"while from his hand i squeeze the golden prize,",2
"on that shaded day,",2
no word for a while spake regin; but he hung his head adown,0
"best gems of nature's cabinet,",1
"plucked from the death, wilt thou repay me thus?",3
my breast was calm as summer's sea,1
"upon her sister dear,",2
thy sleep makes ridiculous.,0
"who the man, who, called a brother.",2
she still must keep the locket to allay,2
"where holds the soul communion with its god,",2
"in the worst of his poems are mines of rich matter,",3
"some thought of me, a last fond prayer",1
"""he whose lot hath been",2
"i turned, and saw behind me surge",2
to gather weeds in the regardless stream.,2
"thy merited reward, the first assay",1
"he said; and while he spoke, with flying speed",2
"but now i see, most cruell hee,",0
"and ye who attend her imperial car,",2
"to sunset they would sip of the tea, drink of the beer, and eat of the",2
down in the west upon the ocean floor,2
"‘these monsters, set out in the open sun,",0
"his hand the captive's fetters broke,",0
"i watch you in your crystal sphere,",2
"how weak this tinkling line,",0
the deer invites no longer,2
skirting the stream.,2
“i’m going to put you on the farm next to it.”,2
"we hear our mother call from deeps of time,",2
and glance securely round.,2
"howled through the dark, like sounds from hell.",0
"i see little and large sea-dots, some inhabited, some uninhabited;",2
"afar the melancholy thunder moaned,",0
like morning glory,1
"some, not so large, in rings,--",2
"the weird pathetic scarlet of day dawning,",0
and my white cottage--plain.,2
"but she guesses he is near,",2
"the willows, and the hazel copses green,",2
"and wit, like ocean, rose and fell?--",3
"by a great master of the past,",1
"and then, as is my wont, i told",2
obliterate the etchings,0
that little barley-cake you keep from him,2
full of the calm that cometh after sleep:,1
an honest tongue may drop a harmless hint.,1
"in all that clang and hewing out of men,",2
"and leave the words unspoken i yet have will to speak.""",2
how you sprang! how you threw off the costumes of peace with indifferent hand;,3
of inward strife for truth and liberty.,3
make a fragrance of her fame.,1
would we were bidden with the rest!,2
"trailing, wrecked, it came to land,",0
then to tell.,2
how they will tell the shipwreck,2
the very gods arising mid their carven images:,2
"on the clear mirror of a loving heart,",1
to me that time did not appeire:,2
--the drones of the community; they feed,2
o'er sweet profounds where only love can see.,1
"looks, and is dumb with awe;",3
to teach in schools of little country towns,2
"oh, those days, so sweet, so happy,",1
"smoothing the clustered hair, and parting it",2
it spoils me for the smiling of the rest’—,1
bedaubed with iridescent dirt.,2
have i played in different countries.,2
in just the dress his century wore;,2
and yet its whole career,2
"luck obeys the downright striker; from the hollow core,",2
"endu'd with human voice and human sense,",2
"nightly down the river going,",2
"was in cremona's workshops made,",2
"they are fastened well, nom d'un chien!",2
"when your rights was our wrongs, john,",3
"take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,",1
"and twitter, and again are still.",2
the wondering rabbi sought the temple's gate.,2
"their hate, and selfishness, and pride!",0
"but i, or any demmercrat, feels comf'table to stan' on,",2
that has a charmingly bourbon air.,1
"of blooming myrtle and faint lemon-flowers,",2
"and, between the river flowing and the fair green trees a-growing,",1
"and tip with feathers, orange and green,",2
the wood giant,2
"at length they turn to nothing else but down,",2
"the pain when it did live,",0
"that you or yours, having an appetite,",2
"blindness like that would scare the mole and bat,",0
godminster chimes,2
a way that safely will my passage guide.”,2
"""play uppe, play uppe, o boston bells!",1
"but o, nevermore can we prison him tight.",0
what flecks the outer gray beyond,2
"(so thick they crowd), 'tis hardly seen.",2
"pride of thy sex, miss harriet martineau!",1
their first-born brother as a god.,1
"by his sacrifice, foreknown",2
"that satraps would have shivered at his frown,",0
"where the moloch of slavery sitteth on high,",0
but all of them are bad enough,0
"and not be nearer therefore to the moon,",2
all these were round my steady paces.,2
"max laid his hand upon the old man's arm,",2
robe us once more in heaven-aspiring creeds,1
i think i'll just call up my wife and tell her,2
kneeling ne'er spoiled silk stockings; quit thy state;,0
"still sigurd rides with the brethren, as oft in the other days,",2
even now eclipses the descending moon!--,2
it will be spring again.,2
"science and song, and all the arts that please;",1
to that mysterious strand.,2
as when i read in god's own holy book.,2
"blood-dipped arrows, which savages make",0
"overleaning, with flickering meaning and sign,",2
does beauty slight you from her gay abodes?,3
for peace or rest too well he saw,2
"and sorrowful to-day, thy children set",0
to his aid the strong reverses,2
hale as the morn and happy as her song.,1
"left the torn human heart, their food and dwelling-place.",0
"the loveliest king of the king-folk, the man of sweetest speech,",1
"ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers,",2
his pass to the majestical far shore.,1
"he plays a little, sings a song,",2
a million torches lighted by thy hand,1
"concerning him ye wot of, thus to think",2
bred onely and completed to the taste,2
"what's de use o' gittin' mopy,",2
"and stiff in fight, but serious drill's despair,",0
"you turn, o jeanne, on our mystery",2
to his ears there came a murmur of far seas beneath the wind,2
"lull’d in her lap, amidst a train of loves,",1
ran ever clearer speech than that did run,1
"a story of the days of old,",2
fifty times the brahmins' offer deluged all the floor.,2
"may meditate a whole youth's loss,",0
"and gladys said,",2
"sometime, when all life's lessons have been learned,",2
"the eternal law,",2
"yet both in different colours hide their art,",2
twas when you stole my maidenhead;,0
and circling wonders fill the vast profound.,1
mere raft of stone;,2
"skins of otter, lynx, and ermine,",2
"the eyes beside had wrung them dry,",2
upon the thought of perfect noon. and when,1
"burns in thee, child?--what good can thee betide,",2
"(like essence-peddlers) thet'll make folks long to be without 'em,",2
who digs last year's potato hill?--,2
"or at the church, she ever bore herself",2
his sweeter voice a just accordance kept.,1
"the limpid ocean mirrors all the stars,",1
and after that the winter cold and drear.,0
oblivion's blankness claims,0
with many sighs;,2
and when i bade the dream,2
"dearest, why should i mourn, whimper, and whine, i that have yet to live?",3
"upon sea-beaten cape,",2
"a spirit, neither here nor there,",2
and listening to thy home's familiar chime,2
"in slumber; for thine enemy never sleeps,",0
whose potent unity and concentric force,1
"strove to raise itself in blessing,",1
"their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace.",3
"thus hee in scorn. the warlike angel mov'd,",0
"""it is a lie, a damned, infernal lie!""",0
"of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch’d",2
long-drawn bill of wine and beer,2
"the visual nerve is withered to the root,",0
honour to the bugle-horn!,1
"and when they reached the house,",2
my prayer away i threw;,2
the poet comes the last!,2
"who cometh over the hills,",2
"the tablet telling where he ""fell on sleep,""--",2
gay little heart!,1
an hundred silken cords are set,2
jarr'd his own golden region; and before,2
with warning cough and threatening wheeze,0
"far from the woods where, when the sun has set,",2
or the bolder art essaying,2
wilt thou our lowly beds with tears of pity lave?',0
time never did assuage;,2
i would not live alway--live alway below!,2
"of the bivouac fire apart,",2
lowly and soft she said it; but spake out louder now:,2
"a fragrance from the cedars, thickly set",2
daih 's de ho'n a blowin'!,2
"meekly in the eternal footsteps trod,",2
"yearns to its source. the spirit thirsts for god,",2
"is this a time to be cloudy and sad,",0
see! neptune’s altars minister their brands:,2
were i once more the lover,2
like slippers after shoes.--,2
how heavy it seemed! as heavy as a stone;,0
"i'm comin', ed.",2

"then this old orchard, sloping to the west;",2
"who, never looking forward, are indeed",2
the things it wrought on; i believe,2
"sky, marsh, my soul, and yonder sail.",2
the dust of half a century lies,2
"on their tracks his eyes were fastened,",2
"around my will to link it with her own,",2
the tale is one of distant skies;,2
"from the pulpit read the preacher, ""goodman garvin and his wife",2

"a spirit of unresting flame,",1
"_you_ took to follerin' where the prophets beckoned,",2
her thoughts are like the lotus,2
"the meadows mine, the mountains mine, --",2
"how they had waited for him, to complete",2
came sages urging on his foamy steed:,2
my father’s sister started when she caught,2
"as under a sunbeam a cloud ascends,",2
look down the shining peaks of all my days,1
with war unhop’d the latians to surprise?,2
but thrown in a heap with a crush and a clatter;,0
i'm here--so far--and starting on again.,2
and breaths were gathering sure,2
"in the twilight of age all things seem strange and phantasmal,",0
"the fraud of priests, the wrong of law,",0
but thy tranquil waters teach,1
"a thousand rubs had flattened down each little cherub's nose,",2
"the cloud is gone that wove the sandstone,",2
ode read at the one hundredth anniversary of the fight at concord bridge,2
"love, on myriad lips fairer than yours, kisses you could not give! . . .",3
whilst this....,2
our frowning foemen of the night,0
"and all their echoes, mourn;",0
his silent sandals swept the mossy green;,2
"thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps",2
"""onaway! my heart sings to thee,",1

he sat beside the governor and said grace;,2
"amidst the gold and the purple, and the pillows of his bed:",2

with the _quart d'heure_ of rabelais!,2
"ah, what a pang of aching sharp surprise",0
it shines superior on a throne of gold:,1
"he never told us what he was,",2
and like the others does not slip,2
should favour equal to the sons of heaven:,2
"while i, ... i built up follies like a wall",0
"is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapours bound.",0
"the orchestra had cheered till they were hoarse,",3
when high i heap it with the weed,2
sang as little children sing;,2
but your dead-ripe ones ranges high fer treatin' nothun bretherin;,0
taught by the sorrows that his age had known,0
the oil upon the puddles dries,2
"sometimes towards heav'n and the full-blazing sun,",1
"""stella, see that grasshopper",2
"brown-gabled, long, and full of seams",2
and catered for it as the cretan bees,2
"in the shadow of the shores; as dead leaves wake,",0
to touch such goodness with a grimy palm.,3
in monumental pomp! no grecian drop,1
"that throng our pilgrimage. its sympathy,",2
"i feel the road unroll,",2
"a privilege, i think,",2
"nor the president in his presidency, nor the rich in his great house.",3
the sundown's golden trail?,1
i would not live alway,2
"shining and shouting each to each that place),",2
"nathless, as hath been often tried,",2
not in the close successive rattle,2
"thus farr to try thee, adam, i was pleas'd,",1
most beauteous isadore!,1
...    and call to him.,2
all foredoomed to melt away;,0
"her lion-port, her awe-commanding face,",1
"sat mournfully guarding their corpses there,",0
"you have done this, says one judge; done that, says another;",2
but she always ran away and left,0
"our hope, our remembrance, our trust,",1
"or by some cabin door, a bush",2
"would split, for size of me.",2
"on which an army once did feast,",2
when blighting was nearest.,0
and bright in heaven's jewelled crown,1

our lives and safeties all;,2

that antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearmen's souls.,2
the hostile cohorts melt away;,3
"these often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,",2
godminster? is it fancy's play?,2
very sleepy with the silence.,2
"under these leafy vaults and walls,",2
"east, west, north, south, are his domain.",2
"a poet in his youth, and the cuckoo-bird",2
"a man in the wars delighting, blind-eyed through right and wrong:",3
were murmuring on the stifling air,0
"when thee, the eyes of that harsh long ago",0
the wheat-blade whispers of the sheaf.,2
"the love that lived through all the stormy past,",3
"and then, if it should be",2
"and raised their eyes above,",2
a graciousness in giving that doth make,1

no answer came; but faint and forlorn,0
sweet poesy from heaven,1
