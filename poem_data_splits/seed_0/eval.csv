"he bent and kissed her head, warm, shining, soft,",1
on to their shining goals:--,1
"with england if the day go hard,",2
"and the tree trembled, and the shouting cries",0
"our hope, our remembrance, our trust,",1
of nature's gold and mints it.,2
"to wakeful frenzy's vigil--rages,",0
the other dark-eyed dears,2
and yet perhaps you had been startled less,2
wid a song up on de way.,2
i kin eat in peace.,1
"taking and giving radiance, and the slopes",1
"whom phoebus taught unerring prophecy,",2
"and say, ‘fie, pale-face! are you english girls",2
and sate as thus upon that slope of lawn,2
"a fleecy cloud,",2
the story of a spavined steed;,2
"except in france; and when it’s found in france,",2
"no, truly.--i will see her; tell my tale,",2
"the present is enough, for common souls,",2
"listening, with half-suspended breath,",2
"then he said ""amarant""; and the damsel drew",2
"and that is why, the lonesome day,",0
in nothing is wanting;,2
"the silence, and the rain.",2
"why write i still all one, ever the same,",2
"tormented by the quickened blood of roots,",0
no man could compete with kwasind.,2
no word for a while spake regin; but he hung his head adown,0
"""i rather should have hewn your limbs away,",0
less often man--the harder of the two.,2
"lull’d in her lap, amidst a train of loves,",1
he who plays with old iagoo,2
then the smile from her bright eyes faded and a flush came over her cheek,3
"and _channing_, with his bland, superior look,",3
and friendship's tenderest sympathy,1
in some lady's gyahden.,2
with spring’s delicious trouble in the ground,3
"the soul with sweetness, and like an adept",1
"i see them mix'd with george's sons,",2
"with passionate longing burning,",1
shine knightly star and plume of snow?,1
"flew to and fro,",2
the quakers' burial-ground.,2
to hide the orb of truth--and every throne,2
playmates' glad symphony.,1
"a ruby, and a pearl, or so,",2
and murmured a strange and solemn air;,0
"and brief related whom they brought, wher found,",2
"bertram finished the last pages, while along the silence ever",2
along the track. afore the noonday meal,2
"upon her sister dear,",2
"a sceptre,--monstrous, winged, intolerable.",0
"""o lord, that didst smother mankind in thy flood,",0
"pulled by mules dat run like rabbits, each one tryin' to git ahead.",2
"i see little and large sea-dots, some inhabited, some uninhabited;",2
abloom by sacred streams,1
"as george commands, let him be wrong or right,",2
low in supplication bending.,2
"a hundred years, and fifty more, had spread their leaves and snows,",2
"and, laying snow-white flowers against my hair.",2
"the limpid ocean mirrors all the stars,",1
the days pass over me,2
and politician at odd seasons.,2
from his lady's white hand caught;,2
"knowing this, that never yet",2
and lips where heavenly smiles would hang and blend,1
did all of them bow downward towards that side,2
he might have been as doubtful once,2
"""sorry?  of course you are, though you compress,",2
the hostile cohorts melt away;,3
"behind the heads of children) compliments,",2
"here on the street as strangers do,",2
"of the boulder-strewn mountain, and when they will crop.",2
"trailing, wrecked, it came to land,",0
"from the slaughtering of my offspring, and the spoiling of my land;",0
make a fragrance of her fame.,1
that by nor sound nor word,2
with ten picked archers of my train;,2
with sincerest conviction their chairs to the shore;,1
until the bitter summons fell--,0
"yet by experience taught we know how good,",2
"for 'twas e'en as a great god's slaying, and they feared the wrath of the sky;",0
"with his thoughts then, as rhyme to rhyme.",2
"if they are hungry, paradise",2
still in hot and heavy splashes fell the tears on every leaf.,0
"and, waking, find it vision,--none the less",2
but homesick tears would fill the eyes,0
"to feel, with bird and stream and tree,",2
with the freedom of lakes and lands.,1
o'er time's delusive tide.,0
"the willows, and the hazel copses green,",2
of robert burns and alexander.,2
"fooled with your promises,",0
"was in cremona's workshops made,",2
"uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.",1
’tis to behold his vengeance for my son.,0
"(so thick they crowd), 'tis hardly seen.",2
i'll be ther in a minit.,2
"rais’d on the seas, the surges to control—",2
did this wood come floating thick,2
"""thou of the god-lent crown,",2
"as they were loosened by that hermit old,",2
turn in the door once and turn once only,2
"in yonder green meadow, to memory dear,",1
o graves of men who lived and died,2
"the play is done,--the curtain drops,",2
"apple-blossoms pink, and low",2
"her scutcheon shows white with a blazon of red,--",2
"to paris, and you make no sign at all.",2
“i’m going to put you on the farm next to it.”,2
that saw the cross without the bear.,2
"is plain, thou say'st: but wherefore god this way",2
"love works at the centre,",2
"""sir, ye shall find him, if ye follow up",2
or dying wail!,0
"soft, discontented eyes!",0
"where the cloudy hangings waver and the flickering shadows fall,",0
"and i turned away to thee,",2
"some moment, nailed on sorrow's cross,",0
"and changing like a poet's rhymes,",2
"with its close-curling gold, and love revived.",1
"but when i read of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with them;",2
like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream.,2
"that throng our pilgrimage. its sympathy,",2
"and hoping chink, she talked of morts of luck:",2
"good ringers, pull your best,"" quoth he.",1
the beauty and the joy of their renewed might.,1
"swifter was the hunter's rowing,",1
a simple strain--,2
"breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door.",2
"so neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen",2
"dark with more clouds than tempests are,",0
"and so,",2
and not alone by gold;,2
in the wild glens rough shepherds will deplore,0
that to the next i may resign my roome,2
"so there on an eve is sigurd in the ancient niblung hall,",2
"jes heavy 'nough to turn a scale thet's doubtfle the wrong way,",2
"begins, but endeth nevermore;",2
her not-nice load.,0
"pilgrim and soldier, saint and sage,",2
"forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain",0
their first-born brother as a god.,1
"howled through the dark, like sounds from hell.",0
"would split, for size of me.",2
and keep my senses straightened,2
an honest tongue may drop a harmless hint.,1
tis that one told us it was life. 'for not,2
"so, then, without a word that might offend",2
many changes have been run,2
"among the sources of thy glorious streams,",1
on us lift up the light,1
and so i should be loved and mourned to-night.,3
mere raft of stone;,2
"even while we gaze, though it awhile avail",2
"leave the garden walls, where blow",2
and heavy as the dead.,0
"said then the lost arch angel, this the seat",2
blow bigger then your own:  the games we play,2
if men are always at a loss,0
they shaped our future; we but carve their names.,2
then ens is represented as father of the predicaments his ten,2
"each by his fiery torture howl and rave,",0
for wanderings sad and lone.,0
"but de lawd is all aroun' you,",2
is lovely round; a beautiful river there,1
"who stood in expectation by,",2
"returne, the starres of morn shall see him rise",2
"here those that in the rapid course delight,",1
indignantly i hurled the cry:,0
at once comes tumbling down the rocky wall;,0
the habitable earth is full of bliss;,1
vain cries--throughout the streets thousands pursued,0
it is but three times thou hast set thine eyes,2
sith i might some counsel find,2
"absently fingering and touching it,",2
"a wagon, overarched with evergreen,",2
bred onely and completed to the taste,2
"their very peaks transparent. 'ere it fade,'",2
"with peace and soft rapture shall teach life to glow,",1
i have lost the urban ways.,2
"with its chang'd countenance, is sent away",2
"as if we guessed what hers have been,",2
to turnus only second in the grace,2
for vessels moulded by a mortal hand?,2
i would not live alway--live alway below!,2
alone went the fair-armed gudrun to her flowery garden-close;,1
"yea, all the world it might be, and all sounds of the earth were stilled",2
their country free and joyous--,1
my winter sports begin.,2
and what are all the prizes won,2
"flutter,",2
"valentines, paper and tinsel,",2
"the former, as the slacken’d reins he drew",2
but still within my bosom's core,2
"i see the thing as clear as light,--",1
"his regal seat, surrounded by his friends.",1
“why won’t the farm next to it do for you?”,2
with sharp turns weaving,2
lift their blue woods in broken chain,2
and leaves the world to darkness and to me.,0
"an echo returned on the cold gray morn,",0
"(distinctly here the spirit sneezed,)",2
i can see how you might. but i don't know!,2
three hours the first november dawn,2
case dey nevah tech a drouf.,2
"a poet in his youth, and the cuckoo-bird",2
beneath the hazel bough;,2
"i see them torn by gallic guns,",0
the head that lay against your knees,2
"hear its low inward singing,",2
she of the rugged sides--,2
i must be home by noon-time with the cart.',2
"want and woe, which torture us,",0
the wheat-blade whispers of the sheaf.,2
honour to the old bow-string!,1
"and finde thee knowing not of beasts alone,",2
even now eclipses the descending moon!--,2
