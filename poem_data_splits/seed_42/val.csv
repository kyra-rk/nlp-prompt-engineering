the dust of half a century lies,2
"has it become to thee a labyrinth never ending,",0
"a spirit of unresting flame,",1
"knowing this, that never yet",2
most beauteous isadore!,1
"by death's frequented ways,",0
how heavy it seemed! as heavy as a stone;,0
three trojans tug at ev’ry lab’ring oar;,2
"warped into adamantine fretwork, hung",2
the red sword sealed their vows!,3
"on their tracks his eyes were fastened,",2
"dark with more clouds than tempests are,",0
"the former, as the slacken’d reins he drew",2
back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?,2
lowly and soft she said it; but spake out louder now:,2
"and _channing_, with his bland, superior look,",3
"luck obeys the downright striker; from the hollow core,",2
"""the snow that husheth all,",2
and circling wonders fill the vast profound.,1
and they whispered to each other:,2
"whom phoebus taught unerring prophecy,",2
me honied paths forsake;,2
"the herded wolves, bold only to pursue;",2
of peace? it is thy father's name. thy life,2
when lips and heart refuse to part again,2
their first-born brother as a god.,1
"no, no, you have dismiss'd me; and i go",2
"nor the president in his presidency, nor the rich in his great house.",3
of brynhilda's love and the wrath of gudrun.,3
"love works at the centre,",2
and catered for it as the cretan bees,2
"and that unrest which men miscall delight,",3
who felt your own thought worthy of record,1
"what gods, what madness, hither steer’d your course?",0
"swifter was the hunter's rowing,",1
‘received that cheque.’ but you!... i send you funds,2
"of blooming myrtle and faint lemon-flowers,",2
who god possesseth,2
"love, on myriad lips fairer than yours, kisses you could not give! . . .",3
"""i mean estelle has always held the purse.""",2
"here those that in the rapid course delight,",1
can storied urn or animated bust:,2
"in a dell mid lawny hills,",2
"unclasped the rusty belt beneath,",2
"around my will to link it with her own,",2
"we're a band!"" said the weary big dragoon.",2
"returne, the starres of morn shall see him rise",2
shine knightly star and plume of snow?,1
my winter sports begin.,2
twas when you stole my maidenhead;,0
"and brief related whom they brought, wher found,",2
less often man--the harder of the two.,2
as hebe's foot bore nectar round,2
"concerning him ye wot of, thus to think",2
"smoothing the clustered hair, and parting it",2
to intercept the sunshine and your face.,2
the call's more urgent when he journeys slow.,2
till the deaf fury comes your house to sweep!',0
"she falls back from the freedom she had hoped.""",2
and yet perhaps you had been startled less,2
i'm always thinkin' long.,2
a wild and stormy sea;,0
yon creamy lily for their pavilion,2
their country free and joyous--,1
wid a song up on de way.,2
all over the vale below.,2
long-drawn bill of wine and beer,2
"sparked a ruby through its heart,",1
the beacon-light that forth they held,2
"an echo returned on the cold gray morn,",0
the lady eunice such a life she flew,2
"so there on an eve is sigurd in the ancient niblung hall,",2
"a privilege, i think,",2
"and thus each tint or shade which falls,",2
"""sir, i have dreamed of you. i pray you, sir,",2
"east, west, north, south, are his domain.",2
"so neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen",2
"seed-field of simpler manners, braver truth,",1
in just the dress his century wore;,2
with level wings swinging,2
"all along down ""injin crik?""",2
"who the man, who, called a brother.",2
"thou too art victor, rochambeau!",1
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.,0
"and ye who attend her imperial car,",2
"meekly in the eternal footsteps trod,",2
"the soul with sweetness, and like an adept",1
"nightly down the river going,",2
"max laid his hand upon the old man's arm,",2
"blindness like that would scare the mole and bat,",0
feel the pulses of the brave,1
"and, waking, find it vision,--none the less",2
"men said, into a smile which guile portended,",0
"when your rights was our wrongs, john,",3
"oh, those days, so sweet, so happy,",1
none will forget it till shall fall the deadly dart!,0
"god prosper long our noble king,",1
"flood his black hearthstone till its flames expire,",0
at once comes tumbling down the rocky wall;,0
"from earth, with the waters of pain.",0
and leaves the world to darkness and to me.,0
it spoils me for the smiling of the rest’—,1
and keep my senses straightened,2
"all right,' says t'other, 'only step round smart;",2
"would split, for size of me.",2
"how weak this tinkling line,",0
"and, between the river flowing and the fair green trees a-growing,",1
"""onaway! my heart sings to thee,",1
"for 'twas e'en as a great god's slaying, and they feared the wrath of the sky;",0
"and finde thee knowing not of beasts alone,",2
"a day's experunce 'd prove to ye, ez easy 'z pull a trigger.",2
sang as little children sing;,2
"a wagon, overarched with evergreen,",2
"""he!  patron!",2
"by his sacrifice, foreknown",2
ashes and jet all hues outshine.,1
"yea, all the world it might be, and all sounds of the earth were stilled",2
but your dead-ripe ones ranges high fer treatin' nothun bretherin;,0
for the greek must ask elsewhere.,2
and willing grow old,2
the blessed memory of thy worth,1
"soft, discontented eyes!",0
--the drones of the community; they feed,2
"daily struggling, though unloved and lonely,",0
"eliab this occasion seized,",2
"mind us of like repose, since god hath set",2
to me that time did not appeire:,2
which clanged along the mountain's marble brow--,2
"dead among the shouting people,",0
"how nature to the soul is moored,",2
"with dews of tropic morning wet,",2
"with the earls of the goths about her: so queenly did she seem,",1
the pyramids have risen.,2
and i am still the same;,2
she listening sate.,2
"on her changed world of ruin, waste and wrack,",0
were murmuring on the stifling air,0
"the sower scatters broad his seed,",2
"that throng our pilgrimage. its sympathy,",2
it's a pretty early start.,2
"said, `pass not, so cold, these manifold",2
"and when they reached the house,",2
"he scarce had ended, when those two approachd",2
but thy tranquil waters teach,1
"and wit, like ocean, rose and fell?--",3
"""play uppe, play uppe, o boston bells!",1
"from the fair brow; she, rising, only said,",2
honour to the old bow-string!,1
to that mysterious strand.,2
and never be forgot in mighty rome,1
wait his returning strength.,2
the climax of those hopes and duties dear,1
"ah! still, methinks, i hear them calling;",2
"they were wet, and glistened with raindrops, shed",2
"when thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, thou didst open the kingdom of heaven to all believers.",3
every day a rich reward will give;,1
with war unhop’d the latians to surprise?,2
waiting the flutter of his homemade fly;,2
he has no calling and he owns no trade.,2
"now, if thou art a poet, tell me not",2
"""as the gods would i see,"" said sigurd, ""though death light up the land.""",3
when waves forget to roll.,2
"tormented by the quickened blood of roots,",0
those cobweb nerves he could not dull within.,0
o'er time's delusive tide.,0
your paynim heroes faster ride,1
"like your nest,",2
"young childhood, with a moisten'd eye,",2
"now rise and look upon me.""  and she rose,",2
"where, all the long and lone daylight,",2
"the meadows mine, the mountains mine, --",2
but homesick tears would fill the eyes,0
"pilgrim and soldier, saint and sage,",2
a tyrian colony; the people made,2
"counts his nectars -- enters,",2
"with its close-curling gold, and love revived.",1
and murmured a strange and solemn air;,0
a graciousness in giving that doth make,1
