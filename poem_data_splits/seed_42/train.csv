those wastes of frozen billows that were hurled,0
"it steam in winter like an ox's breath,",2
and what are all the prizes won,2
"that you or yours, having an appetite,",2
"blood-dipped arrows, which savages make",0
"yea, soon, no consonant unsmooth",2
"when thee, the eyes of that harsh long ago",0
"when the brow is cold as the marble stone,",0
"""now the place where the accident occurred----""",2
"the loveliest king of the king-folk, the man of sweetest speech,",1
"then rose they up around him,",2
have i played in different countries.,2
the days pass over me,2
"the china dustless, the keen knife-blades bright,",1
"thus farr to try thee, adam, i was pleas'd,",1
an hundred silken cords are set,2
"of the bivouac fire apart,",2
"brightly expressive as the twins of leda,",1
"he bent and kissed her head, warm, shining, soft,",1
"begins, but endeth nevermore;",2
"the orchestra had cheered till they were hoarse,",3
"fit for an abbot of theleme,",2
"and virtue's bright image, enstamped on the mind,",1
"fix’d on the walls with wonder and surprise,",1
"he plays a little, sings a song,",2
and at my door they cower and die.,0
to touch such goodness with a grimy palm.,3
the moon and the stars were anxious,0
did this wood come floating thick,2
with such vehement force and might,0
bred onely and completed to the taste,2
on to their shining goals:--,1
"of night, and all things now retir'd to rest",2
"passing to lap thy waters, crushed the flower",0
o'er sweet profounds where only love can see.,1
on us lift up the light,1
"our saxon tongue has known,--",2
and make the liveliest monkey melancholy.,0
"he said; and while he spoke, with flying speed",2
"but the great spirit plants it in our hearts,",2
"in the shadow of the shores; as dead leaves wake,",0
"but half the secret told,",2
around it cling.,2
"tinkle, tinkle, sweetly it sung to us,",1
"from the overhanging branches,",2
"yearns to its source. the spirit thirsts for god,",2
"""i rather should have hewn your limbs away,",0
"they beached their galley on the shore, and sought",2
vain cries--throughout the streets thousands pursued,0
