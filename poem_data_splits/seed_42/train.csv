"in the worst of his poems are mines of rich matter,",3
henceforth to labor's chivalry,2
thy hands all cunning arts that women prize.,1
"among the sources of thy glorious streams,",1
tis the djinns' wild streaming swarm,2
"though books on manners are not out of print,",2
and bow to dread inquisitor and worship lords of dust;,0
as when i read in god's own holy book.,2
"shining and shouting each to each that place),",2
"flutter,",2

that passed with you and me.--,2
then to tell.,2
one lucent foot's delaying tip,2
taught by the sorrows that his age had known,0
from her stately place on high.,1
"that satraps would have shivered at his frown,",0
and heavy as the dead.,0
"their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace.",3
the sundown's golden trail?,1
as if she were a woman. we who have clipt,2
"i see them mix'd with george's sons,",2
"for her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,",1
"far from the woods where, when the sun has set,",2
and not alone by gold;,2
"when i peruse the conquered fame of heroes, and the victories of mighty generals, i do not envy the generals,",3
"is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapours bound.",0
all foredoomed to melt away;,0
“i’m going to put you on the farm next to it.”,2
"down the dark future, through long generations,",0
and to the tender heart and brave,1
"burns in thee, child?--what good can thee betide,",2
was she not somewhat that he could not rule,2
"is this a time to be cloudy and sad,",0
along the track. afore the noonday meal,2
"but de lawd is all aroun' you,",2
godminster? is it fancy's play?,2
then he stripped the shirt of wampum,2
to hide the orb of truth--and every throne,2
since ferdinand and you begun,2
in latmian fountains long ago.,2
"but when i read of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with them;",2
"still sigurd rides with the brethren, as oft in the other days,",2
an honest tongue may drop a harmless hint.,1
"which leans over to the lane,",2
"so thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,",2
above the myriad roofs and spires rise;,2
kneeling ne'er spoiled silk stockings; quit thy state;,0
many changes have been run,2
"and then, if it should be",2
very sleepy with the silence.,2
"i left the place with all my might, --",2
a way that safely will my passage guide.”,2
"pulled by mules dat run like rabbits, each one tryin' to git ahead.",2
"left the torn human heart, their food and dwelling-place.",0
but she always ran away and left,0
"looks, and is dumb with awe;",3
whilst this....,2
"overleaning, with flickering meaning and sign,",2
"is plain, thou say'st: but wherefore god this way",2
"busy, with sacerdotal tailorings",2
"thy merited reward, the first assay",1

when the glance hast lost its beam;,0
and to thy brief captivity was brought,2
"science and song, and all the arts that please;",1
"let dat cradle swing,",2
with pale blue berries. in these peaceful shades--,1
the end of the play.,2
"i watch you in your crystal sphere,",2
"and fears are added, and avenging flame.",0
to make a body curse.,0
"at least if so we can, and by the head",2
"best gems of nature's cabinet,",1
came in slow pomp;--the moving pomp might seem,2
"(so thick they crowd), 'tis hardly seen.",2
yet that whip's name too noble,2
see! neptune’s altars minister their brands:,2
"upon sea-beaten cape,",2
and friendship's tenderest sympathy,1
"they are fastened well, nom d'un chien!",2
i would not live alway--live alway below!,2
or the bolder art essaying,2
the crack as of her splitting. did she take,2
here on the cliff beneath the oleanders,2
you sha' n't roll yo' eyes at me.,0
with spring’s delicious trouble in the ground,3
"some come ridin' in top-buggies wid de w'eels all painted red,",2
"where the moloch of slavery sitteth on high,",0
"shall dwindle, shall blend,",2
and call that brilliant flower the painted cup.,1
in nothing is wanting;,2
his pass to the majestical far shore.,1
o sun-hint that hath overspread,2
"tain't the words alone, but feelin's,",2
"leading downward to the river,",2
and the lure of what is called heaven is little or nothing to me.,3
the oriole's fledglings fifty times,2

the things it wrought on; i believe,2
snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin,2

"how over, though, for even me who knew",2
to gather weeds in the regardless stream.,2
"from alton bay to sandwich dome,",2

"you shall not find the sons of atreus here,",2
"well, i guess i looked at that hand",2
who fishes in the frog-pond still?,2
"except in france; and when it’s found in france,",2
"a fragrance from the cedars, thickly set",2
"or at the church, she ever bore herself",2
"sounded o'er earth and sea its blast of war,",0

the very gods arising mid their carven images:,2
