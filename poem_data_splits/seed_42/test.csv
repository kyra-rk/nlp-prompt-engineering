with sharp turns weaving,2

"with his thoughts then, as rhyme to rhyme.",2
"shall yet be glad for him, and he shall bless",1
"and, waking, find it vision,--none the less",2
and catered for it as the cretan bees,2
"a wagon, overarched with evergreen,",2
i sate down beneath the beech,2

"dey kin talk from hyeah to yandah,",2
"overleaning, with flickering meaning and sign,",2
who fishes in the frog-pond still?,2
and murmured a strange and solemn air;,0
"in our embraces we again enfold her,",1

"the present is enough, for common souls,",2
"shall dwindle, shall blend,",2
in monumental pomp! no grecian drop,1

of brynhilda's love and the wrath of gudrun.,3

"may george, beloved by all the nations round,",1
"nathless, as hath been often tried,",2
lowly and soft she said it; but spake out louder now:,2
"on which an army once did feast,",2
yet was this period my time of joy:,1
"to sunset they would sip of the tea, drink of the beer, and eat of the",2
who god possesseth,2
glad on its stone-built hearth; and thorough the wide-mouthed smoke-flue,2
"else, suffer’d, it will set the heart on fire,",0
his silent sandals swept the mossy green;,2
which goaded him in his distress,0
none will forget it till shall fall the deadly dart!,0
