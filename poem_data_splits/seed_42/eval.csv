this endless outrage shall they still sustain?,0
"and kissed him with a sister's kiss,",2
o that i were where helen lies,2
"we're a band!"" said the weary big dragoon.",2
still in hot and heavy splashes fell the tears on every leaf.,0
"around my will to link it with her own,",2
"left the torn human heart, their food and dwelling-place.",0
"science and song, and all the arts that please;",1
"returne, the starres of morn shall see him rise",2
"and country eyes, and quiet faces --",2
"to rise upon some other shore,",2
"said, `pass not, so cold, these manifold",2
"whether they met on festal eve, in field,",2
"whose voices, hushed, have left our pathway lonely,",0
"here comes the cripple jane!""  and by a fountain's side",0
tis the chronicle of art.,2
"and that is why, the lonesome day,",0
"i left the place with all my might, --",2
"_you_ took to follerin' where the prophets beckoned,",2
despised am i by those who call'd me friend,3
and when they reached the strait symplegades,2
"they say that 'time assuages,' --",2
the message is not like what i have learned,2
"ah, douglass, we have fall'n on evil days,",0
"""what hope wouldst thou hope, o sigurd, ere we kiss, we twain, and depart?""",3
"even hearts estranged would turn once more to me,",3
robe us once more in heaven-aspiring creeds,1
"at dusk of eve,",2
where its first shadow casts the holy mountain;,2
now is past since last we met,2
o sun-hint that hath overspread,2
an honest tongue may drop a harmless hint.,1
"and gladys said,",2
"a hundred years, and fifty more, had spread their leaves and snows,",2
"when on the boughs the purple buds expand,",2
"well, i guess i looked at that hand",2
"and, wildly tossed from cheeks and chin,",2
"would split, for size of me.",2
--the drones of the community; they feed,2
shall troy renew’d be forc’d and fir’d again?,2
"for 'twas e'en as a great god's slaying, and they feared the wrath of the sky;",0
"crouching and sleeping neath its grassy lair,",2
her not-nice load.,0
she of the rugged sides--,2
"then oer the rushes flies again,",2
"leave the garden walls, where blow",2
my winter sports begin.,2
with sincerest conviction their chairs to the shore;,1
nile shall pursue his changeless way:,2
both the unseen and the seen;,2
and all the honors that he sought to leave,2
but she always ran away and left,0
and very venus of a pipe.,2
"no rest that throbbing slave may ask,",0
alas! their right to joy is plain.,1
"how weak this tinkling line,",0
"leading downward to the river,",2
"and _channing_, with his bland, superior look,",3
"no, truly.--i will see her; tell my tale,",2
“i’m going to put you on the farm next to it.”,2
and like the others does not slip,2
ashes and jet all hues outshine.,1
"with the whole world gone blind,",0
"but, through the war-cloud, pray to thee",3
but thy tranquil waters teach,1
"""i mean estelle has always held the purse.""",2
"""onaway! my heart sings to thee,",1
the tribute of this verse.,2
"in town, an' not the leanest runt",0
"then along the river strand,",2
"now rise and look upon me.""  and she rose,",2
"on their tracks his eyes were fastened,",2
"from the fair brow; she, rising, only said,",2
heart as though with ashes blending;,0
"under these leafy vaults and walls,",2
"nightly down the river going,",2
"lord, remember me!""",2
"grander, nobler, than that pilot",1
that by nor sound nor word,2
"a spirit, neither here nor there,",2
blow bigger then your own:  the games we play,2
that in their holes abed at close of day,2
"and fears are added, and avenging flame.",0
"on her changed world of ruin, waste and wrack,",0
and breaths were gathering sure,2
"might, looking up, see dian dip",2
"ez though i wanted to enlist 'em,",2
"but i, or any demmercrat, feels comf'table to stan' on,",2
and in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes:,1
and i am still the same;,2
"pilgrim and soldier, saint and sage,",2
"a privilege, i think,",2
and politician at odd seasons.,2
tis gone past recalling!,2
"mind us of like repose, since god hath set",2
"has it become to thee a labyrinth never ending,",0
your paynim heroes faster ride,1
"among the sources of thy glorious streams,",1
like slippers after shoes.--,2
"i see them torn by gallic guns,",0
whose potent unity and concentric force,1
my daily thoughts perpetual converse held,2
"and she said: ""what dost thou, brynhild? what matter dost thou seek?""",2
and circling wonders fill the vast profound.,1
"where your hair from your forehead swerves,",2
at once comes tumbling down the rocky wall;,0
i cannot tell rude listeners,0
"a different man was brother timothy,",2
ef zeke had be'n the bigges' man,2
"the oriole in the elm; the noisy jay,",2
"or at the church, she ever bore herself",2
"an echo returned on the cold gray morn,",0
"smoothing the clustered hair, and parting it",2
swifter far than youth's delight--,1
that passed with you and me.--,2
"from earth, with the waters of pain.",0
how they will tell the shipwreck,2
rejection of his humanness,0
"what's de use o' gittin' mopy,",2
and yon outlying range invites,2
turn in the door once and turn once only,2
"who stood in expectation by,",2
"dark with more clouds than tempests are,",0
for wanderings sad and lone.,0
wait his returning strength.,2
while brain wore a plumeless casque; not he,2
and in some deep and narrow bay then sleeps,2
"flutter,",2
"bertram finished the last pages, while along the silence ever",2
"with shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn’d.",0
"ah, soul of mine! so brave and wise",1
but homesick tears would fill the eyes,0
and the lure of what is called heaven is little or nothing to me.,3
till after-poets only knew,2
he has no calling and he owns no trade.,2
"he smell de bacon cookin', an' he hyeah de fiah hum;",2
"let me all risk, and leave the deep heart dumb",0
"is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapours bound.",0
the deer invites no longer,2
"the former, as the slacken’d reins he drew",2
"who had my mother's servant been,",2
honour to the bugle-horn!,1
sith i might some counsel find,2
twas when you stole my maidenhead;,0
"what though the claret circled well,",2
and heavy as the dead.,0
to that mysterious strand.,2
it spoils me for the smiling of the rest’—,1
"lull’d in her lap, amidst a train of loves,",1
and to thy brief captivity was brought,2
"trailing, wrecked, it came to land,",0
all these were round my steady paces.,2
three hours the first november dawn,2
and seek the danger i was forc’d to shun.,0
"was in cremona's workshops made,",2
"dead among the shouting people,",0
all over the vale below.,2
and bow to dread inquisitor and worship lords of dust;,0
no controversial hebraist was the dame;,2
"they are fastened well, nom d'un chien!",2
the crack as of her splitting. did she take,2
"plucked from the death, wilt thou repay me thus?",3
"here those that in the rapid course delight,",1
"a spirit of unresting flame,",1
along the track. afore the noonday meal,2
"these are the tales, or new or old,",2
our frowning foemen of the night,0
i'm always thinkin' long.,2
"we were content to show,",2
have roughened in the gales!,2
can storied urn or animated bust:,2
henceforth to labor's chivalry,2
"where, all the long and lone daylight,",2
but your dead-ripe ones ranges high fer treatin' nothun bretherin;,0
for the greek must ask elsewhere.,2
"no angry bolt, but harmless flame.",3
to turnus only second in the grace,2
that day.,2
the red sword sealed their vows!,3
"warped into adamantine fretwork, hung",2
"all along down ""injin crik?""",2
"(so thick they crowd), 'tis hardly seen.",2
"young childhood, with a moisten'd eye,",2
"and sorrowful to-day, thy children set",0
"an angel had not startled him,",2
the dust of half a century lies,2
"how your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard in their stead;",3
i'll be ther in a minit.,2
at his approaching footsteps.  winter came,2
"said then the lost arch angel, this the seat",2
"swifter was the hunter's rowing,",1
"so neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen",2
mere raft of stone;,2
"but de lawd is all aroun' you,",2
how many times we must have met,2
were i once more the lover,2
and they whispered to each other:,2
from her stately place on high.,1
fifty times the brahmins' offer deluged all the floor.,2
"sees the clouds reel and roll above our head,",2
"howled through the dark, like sounds from hell.",0
"tain't the words alone, but feelin's,",2
while the rude winds blow off each shadowy crown.,0
"in the worst of his poems are mines of rich matter,",3
the beauty and the joy of their renewed might.,1
of peace? it is thy father's name. thy life,2
"the silence, and the rain.",2
the call's more urgent when he journeys slow.,2
"still sigurd rides with the brethren, as oft in the other days,",2
"by death's frequented ways,",0
"at least if so we can, and by the head",2
taught by the sorrows that his age had known,0
a wild and stormy sea;,0
but laon? on high freedom's desert land,2
it shines superior on a throne of gold:,1
"he stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;",0
"and then, to go to sleep;",2
from his lady's white hand caught;,2
"eliab this occasion seized,",2
"some, not so large, in rings,--",2
