"the meadows mine, the mountains mine, --",2
"that, following this slight trace,",2
"on the clear mirror of a loving heart,",1
that antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearmen's souls.,2
"we’ll say instead, the inconsequent creature, man,—",2
"through the salt sea foam,",2
with spring’s delicious trouble in the ground,3
"the tablet telling where he ""fell on sleep,""--",2
in nothing is wanting;,2
"our present, our past, our to be,",2
as when i read in god's own holy book.,2
the poet comes the last!,2
upon the thought of perfect noon. and when,1
"shining and shouting each to each that place),",2
"max laid his hand upon the old man's arm,",2
my winter sports begin.,2
ashes and jet all hues outshine.,1
when the glance hast lost its beam;,0
"yet both in different colours hide their art,",2
gay little heart!,1
even now eclipses the descending moon!--,2
and give a meaning to their lives; and still,2
"the weird pathetic scarlet of day dawning,",0
"(distinctly here the spirit sneezed,)",2
"thou feel'st it burning, in and in,--and fear",0
"i'm comin', ed.",2
"the oriole in the elm; the noisy jay,",2
"from the slaughtering of my offspring, and the spoiling of my land;",0
in some lady's gyahden.,2
as childhood's sweet delight.,1
"and _channing_, with his bland, superior look,",3
but because she stept to her star right on through death,3
"from the pulpit read the preacher, ""goodman garvin and his wife",2
"what gods, what madness, hither steer’d your course?",0
and i am still the same;,2
attend your brother to the stygian flood.”,2
"""play uppe, play uppe, o boston bells!",1
the very gods arising mid their carven images:,2
"endu'd with human voice and human sense,",2
"sometimes towards heav'n and the full-blazing sun,",1
"pride of thy sex, miss harriet martineau!",1
in just the dress his century wore;,2
"you didn't stop for fuss,--",2
a wild and stormy sea;,0
"""onaway! my heart sings to thee,",1
"of sainthood in purple the pattern and pick,",2
"from god's design, with threads of rain!",2
till after-poets only knew,2
"let us do our work as well,",2
"all hastening onward, yet none seemed to know",2
"soft, discontented eyes!",0
"then oer the rushes flies again,",2
"and finde thee knowing not of beasts alone,",2
my breast was calm as summer's sea,1
i do not keer a jot;,2
i lay and watched the lonely gloom;,0
"on that shaded day,",2
have seen the danger which i dared not look,0
it spoils me for the smiling of the rest’—,1
whatever anybody had,2
"that throng our pilgrimage. its sympathy,",2
"in slumber; for thine enemy never sleeps,",0
to that mysterious strand.,2
faint voices lifted shrill with pain,0
"the china dustless, the keen knife-blades bright,",1
"as under a sunbeam a cloud ascends,",2
"forever quivering o'er his task,",0
"counts his nectars -- enters,",2
as if she were a woman. we who have clipt,2
how seen? how known? as through your glass,2
"for high, and yet more high, the murmurs swell",2
"oh, those days, so sweet, so happy,",1
"he smell de bacon cookin', an' he hyeah de fiah hum;",2
the dust of half a century lies,2
"begins, but endeth nevermore;",2
the lady eunice such a life she flew,2
"nathless, as hath been often tried,",2
for suddenly the sweet bells overcame,1
that has a charmingly bourbon air.,1
lowly and soft she said it; but spake out louder now:,2
and breaths were gathering sure,2
"where, all the long and lone daylight,",2
"our saxon tongue has known,--",2
"and the words which he utters, are--worship, or die!",0
"down the dark future, through long generations,",0
vain cries--throughout the streets thousands pursued,0
but homesick tears would fill the eyes,0
i must be home by noon-time with the cart.',2
"they say that 'time assuages,' --",2
"the pain when it did live,",0
our lives and safeties all;,2
"""stella, see that grasshopper",2
troubling with life the waters of the world.,0
that _she_ should walk beside him on the rocks,2
then he stripped the shirt of wampum,2
"under these leafy vaults and walls,",2
"let dat cradle swing,",2
"three lives, three strides, three foot-prints in the sand;",2
the morning and the evening made his day.,2
"""a quick consumption, that no art could cure!",2
the head that lay against your knees,2
i think i'll just call up my wife and tell her,2
a golden helm his front and head surrounds,2
"""the snow that husheth all,",2
who god possesseth,2
thy hands all cunning arts that women prize.,1
which clanged along the mountain's marble brow--,2
"has it become to thee a labyrinth never ending,",0
with pale blue berries. in these peaceful shades--,1
the beacon-light that forth they held,2
"ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers,",2

then to tell.,2
"i see two boats with nets, lying off the shore of paumanok, quite still;",2
"was in cremona's workshops made,",2
"the king ordains their entrance, and ascends",1
a graciousness in giving that doth make,1
"is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapours bound.",0
wilt thou our lowly beds with tears of pity lave?',0
"the eternal law,",2
oblivion's blankness claims,0
and never be forgot in mighty rome,1
"the limpid ocean mirrors all the stars,",1
the sundown's golden trail?,1
"i'm safe enlisted fer the war,",2
around thy place of slumber glowing!,1
but your dead-ripe ones ranges high fer treatin' nothun bretherin;,0
rang the beautiful wild chimes,1
"dark with more clouds than tempests are,",0
"to sunset they would sip of the tea, drink of the beer, and eat of the",2
"tells us that the day is ended.""",2
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.,0
"peep timidly from out its nest,",2
lift their blue woods in broken chain,2
his pass to the majestical far shore.,1
"a thousand rubs had flattened down each little cherub's nose,",2
"the loveliest king of the king-folk, the man of sweetest speech,",1
"an old smoaked blanket arches oer his head,",2
and i've been like that silly girl.,0
swifter far than youth's delight--,1
whilst this....,2
"by death's frequented ways,",0
and so i should be loved and mourned to-night.,3
"the one good man in the world who knows me, --",1
"a day's experunce 'd prove to ye, ez easy 'z pull a trigger.",2
so that ye for them are made,2

and bow to dread inquisitor and worship lords of dust;,0
"mine are calm and tranquil days,",1
"gnossian his shafts, and lycian was his bow:",2
with the _quart d'heure_ of rabelais!,2
"a wagon, overarched with evergreen,",2
"that moved in the beginning o'er his face,",2
her eye proclaims her of the briton line:,2
"when i peruse the conquered fame of heroes, and the victories of mighty generals, i do not envy the generals,",3
no answer came; but faint and forlorn,0
the deer invites no longer,2
and they whispered to each other:,2
as hebe's foot bore nectar round,2
"it steam in winter like an ox's breath,",2
"let those whom nature hath not made for store,",2

tis the chronicle of art.,2
"miles off, three dangerous miles, is home;",0
yet that whip's name too noble,2
"you hardly know when you are coming back,",2
i sate down beneath the beech,2
but now for me than you—the other way.,2
"at length they turn to nothing else but down,",2
who digs last year's potato hill?--,2
