in monumental pomp! no grecian drop,1
"well, i guess i looked at that hand",2
many changes have been run,2
"would split, for size of me.",2

to intercept the sunshine and your face.,2
above the myriad roofs and spires rise;,2
"thou too art victor, rochambeau!",1
the hostile cohorts melt away;,3
"a privilege, i think,",2
beneath thy gracious feet!,1
"he plays a little, sings a song,",2
"her visions and those we have seen,--",2
"i feel the road unroll,",2
"from the fair brow; she, rising, only said,",2
"valentines, paper and tinsel,",2
"ah! still, methinks, i hear them calling;",2
"who had my mother's servant been,",2
"hear its low inward singing,",2

"and tip with feathers, orange and green,",2
"on which an army once did feast,",2
skirting the stream.,2
kneeling ne'er spoiled silk stockings; quit thy state;,0
did this wood come floating thick,2

is lovely round; a beautiful river there,1
with such vehement force and might,0
"and so on. then a worthless gaud or two,",0
a tyrian colony; the people made,2
sent by an hand unseen;,2
"but i, or any demmercrat, feels comf'table to stan' on,",2
"uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.",1
"it would be different if more people came,",2
along the track. afore the noonday meal,2
