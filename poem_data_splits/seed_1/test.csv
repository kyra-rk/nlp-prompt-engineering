"the willows, and the hazel copses green,",2
nor looks on that dread place,0
"swing, like a ship at anchor, roun' my base,",2
lowly and soft she said it; but spake out louder now:,2
"in all that clang and hewing out of men,",2
"would my heart and life flow onward, deathward, through this dream of",3
"thou wovest dreams of joy and fear,",3
"take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,",1
live with heav'ns choicest constant blessings crown'd!,1
the beacon-light that forth they held,2
"whose voices, hushed, have left our pathway lonely,",0
ashes and jet all hues outshine.,1
his head is bowed. he thinks on men and kings.,2
whose instinct was to listen and obey.,2
"the one good man in the world who knows me, --",1
"as under a sunbeam a cloud ascends,",2
"soon ez she gits out o' sight,",2
now is past since last we met,2
"i'm comin', ed.",2
"thus farr to try thee, adam, i was pleas'd,",1
"is plain, thou say'st: but wherefore god this way",2
or the bolder art essaying,2
"""what did you hear, for instance?"" willis said.",2
whose anvil's even din,2
to accomplish suicide.,0
our wavering apparitions pass,2
"gnossian his shafts, and lycian was his bow:",2
who digs last year's potato hill?--,2
"though books on manners are not out of print,",2
rejection of his humanness,0
and lips where heavenly smiles would hang and blend,1
"who had my mother's servant been,",2
"and say, ‘fie, pale-face! are you english girls",2
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.,0
"unclasped the rusty belt beneath,",2
"lift not your hands in the banded war,",2
and tell you in what greek and latin name,2
"to rise upon some other shore,",2
"for 'twas e'en as a great god's slaying, and they feared the wrath of the sky;",0
the other dark-eyed dears,2
"sounded o'er earth and sea its blast of war,",0
it spoils me for the smiling of the rest’—,1
"the china dustless, the keen knife-blades bright,",1
"of sainthood in purple the pattern and pick,",2
both the unseen and the seen;,2
"""the snow that husheth all,",2
"at length they turn to nothing else but down,",2
"let dat cradle swing,",2
i'll be ther in a minit.,2
have roughened in the gales!,2
and the lure of what is called heaven is little or nothing to me.,3
"you hardly know when you are coming back,",2
their country free and joyous--,1
"(distinctly here the spirit sneezed,)",2
"god prosper long our noble king,",1
"left the torn human heart, their food and dwelling-place.",0
despised am i by those who call'd me friend,3
above the myriad roofs and spires rise;,2
"from his own tripod, and his holy tree;",2
"shining and shouting each to each that place),",2
upon the thought of perfect noon. and when,1
"well, i guess i looked at that hand",2
their first-born brother as a god.,1
"the king ordains their entrance, and ascends",1
"two mighty cities shone, and ever",1
which clanged along the mountain's marble brow--,2
"harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:",0
"in town, an' not the leanest runt",0
"a privilege, i think,",2
no answer came; but faint and forlorn,0
--the drones of the community; they feed,2
"the tablet telling where he ""fell on sleep,""--",2
her not-nice load.,0
"he says he’s hungry,—he would rather have",2
"mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled,",0
the blessed memory of thy worth,1
"endu'd with human voice and human sense,",2
"is shorter than a snake's delay,",2
"darling, the merciful father",1
how seen? how known? as through your glass,2
"who, never looking forward, are indeed",2
for that’s his specialty. what creature else,2
along the track. afore the noonday meal,2
"it steam in winter like an ox's breath,",2
"and then, as is my wont, i told",2
wilt thou our lowly beds with tears of pity lave?',0
"where, all the long and lone daylight,",2
"fix’d on the walls with wonder and surprise,",1
"that we must change for heav'n, this mournful gloom",0
"peep timidly from out its nest,",2
"what once has been and ne'er shall be again,",2
tis the chronicle of art.,2
"such days as thou, not even thou didst know,",2
"of long-uncoupled bed, and childless eld,",2
even now eclipses the descending moon!--,2
i kin eat in peace.,1
from its stem the ripening ear--,2
the story of a spavined steed;,2
"and the tree trembled, and the shouting cries",0
lift up the favour of thy count'nance bright.,1
"when i peruse the conquered fame of heroes, and the victories of mighty generals, i do not envy the generals,",3
the morning and the evening made his day.,2
"i see the thing as clear as light,--",1
from her stately place on high.,1
in just the dress his century wore;,2
"from god's design, with threads of rain!",2
inexorable death; and claims his right.,0
then he stripped the shirt of wampum,2
"the foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,",0
"no, truly.--i will see her; tell my tale,",2
long-drawn bill of wine and beer,2
"their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace.",3
"and twitter, and again are still.",2
"for high, and yet more high, the murmurs swell",2
i sate down beneath the beech,2
"moonstruck with love, and this still thames had heard",1
made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet,2
"the crown of sorrow on their heads, their loss",0
that has a charmingly bourbon air.,1
"dearest, why should i mourn, whimper, and whine, i that have yet to live?",3
"when, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied",0
"""i rather should have hewn your limbs away,",0
"the dusky daughter of the sun,--",2
"all passionate-sweet, as are the loving beams",1
bred onely and completed to the taste,2
"""i mean estelle has always held the purse.""",2
"he hid his gold,",2
would he move--so as yet they made nothing of land;,2
vain cries--throughout the streets thousands pursued,0
a wail of utter agony,0
"with its close-curling gold, and love revived.",1
"each by his fiery torture howl and rave,",0
"under these leafy vaults and walls,",2
and yet perhaps you had been startled less,2
"these often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,",2
"""onaway! my heart sings to thee,",1
"by his sacrifice, foreknown",2
"“the nymph, who scatters flaming fires around,",0
and breaths were gathering sure,2
"then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,",2
"""before god, sir, i vow, when you are gone,",2
"said my companion, 'i will show you soon",2
"take the warm welcome of new friends with thee,",1
"miles off, three dangerous miles, is home;",0
"an old smoaked blanket arches oer his head,",2
"--so they feast in the hall of atli, and that eve is the first of the seven.",1
it is but three times thou hast set thine eyes,2
of robert burns and alexander.,2
which 'mongst the wanton gods a foul reproach was held.,0
the echoing sounds grow fainter and then cease;,2
and murmured a strange and solemn air;,0
"his hand the captive's fetters broke,",0
and like the others does not slip,2
"yet both in different colours hide their art,",2
"is this a time to be cloudy and sad,",0
"max laid his hand upon the old man's arm,",2
the quakers' burial-ground.,2
and give a meaning to their lives; and still,2
"that moved in the beginning o'er his face,",2
"“acca, ’tis past! he swims before my sight,",2
an honest tongue may drop a harmless hint.,1
"thou feel'st it burning, in and in,--and fear",0
jarr'd his own golden region; and before,2
"(so thick they crowd), 'tis hardly seen.",2
"yea, all the world it might be, and all sounds of the earth were stilled",2
that day.,2
"has it become to thee a labyrinth never ending,",0
and what are all the prizes won,2
and in some deep and narrow bay then sleeps,2
how they will tell the shipwreck,2
"""a quick consumption, that no art could cure!",2
"he scarce had ended, when those two approachd",2
"but the great spirit plants it in our hearts,",2
ode read at the one hundredth anniversary of the fight at concord bridge,2
"nor the president in his presidency, nor the rich in his great house.",3
many changes have been run,2
"and what then doth he gather? if we know,",2
every day a rich reward will give;,1
"and leave the words unspoken i yet have will to speak.""",2
"i would don my hose of homespun gray,",2
and ever the rocks' disdain;,0
"yet by experience taught we know how good,",2
when lips and heart refuse to part again,2
the dust of half a century lies,2
"they are fastened well, nom d'un chien!",2
"it would be different if more people came,",2
"and virtue's bright image, enstamped on the mind,",1
o sun-hint that hath overspread,2
the red sword sealed their vows!,3
in monumental pomp! no grecian drop,1
see! neptune’s altars minister their brands:,2
"he plays a little, sings a song,",2
let sighing breezes call.,2
of peace? it is thy father's name. thy life,2
or dying wail!,0
"then rose they up around him,",2
back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?,2
"some, not so large, in rings,--",2
"smoothing the clustered hair, and parting it",2
"when the brow is cold as the marble stone,",0
a simple strain--,2
and in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes:,1
the sundown's golden trail?,1
in nothing is wanting;,2
that _she_ should walk beside him on the rocks,2
down in lovah's lane.,2
"ah, soul of mine! so brave and wise",1
"our saxon tongue has known,--",2
fifty times the brahmins' offer deluged all the floor.,2
"our present, our past, our to be,",2
tis gone past recalling!,2
"oh, those days, so sweet, so happy,",1
"with passionate longing burning,",1
who god possesseth,2
to intercept the sunshine and your face.,2
"and, laying snow-white flowers against my hair.",2
"the fear of angels, awful though they be,",0
"behind the heads of children) compliments,",2
"first feels the gathering head of steam,",2
"as if we guessed what hers have been,",2
"you'll not want business, for we need a lot",2
