"with shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn’d.",0
"then this old orchard, sloping to the west;",2
at once comes tumbling down the rocky wall;,0
and not alone by gold;,2
"by death's frequented ways,",0
"around my will to link it with her own,",2
through swiftly changing season.,2
"seed-field of simpler manners, braver truth,",1
that little barley-cake you keep from him,2
"how the white mountain-tops distinctly shine,",1
"in the twilight of age all things seem strange and phantasmal,",0
"how nature to the soul is moored,",2
when waves forget to roll.,2
"east, west, north, south, are his domain.",2
"but it is not enough, ah! not enough",2
while with thy childlike faith we lean,2
"precisely, at all events, what he ought not,",2
when high i heap it with the weed,2
"knowing this, that never yet",2
"in our embraces we again enfold her,",1
and my white cottage--plain.,2
"i see them torn by gallic guns,",0
"youth, i do adore thee;",1
"who stood in expectation by,",2
come up like ocean murmurs. but the scene,2
"if they are hungry, paradise",2
"those hours the ancient timepiece told,--",2
"the orchestra had cheered till they were hoarse,",3
were murmuring on the stifling air,0
"a spirit, neither here nor there,",2
on to their shining goals:--,1
from his lady's white hand caught;,2
"i watch you in your crystal sphere,",2
"let fall on her a rose-leaf rain of dreams,",1
all these were round my steady paces.,2
"blood-dipped arrows, which savages make",0
"thus hee in scorn. the warlike angel mov'd,",0
"who cometh over the hills,",2
you sha' n't roll yo' eyes at me.,0
"tell me, the charms that lovers seek",2
"as george commands, let him be wrong or right,",2
a woman has been strangled with less weight:,0
and all the honors that he sought to leave,2
shall live my highland mary.,2
"""what hope wouldst thou hope, o sigurd, ere we kiss, we twain, and depart?""",3
"to wakeful frenzy's vigil--rages,",0
