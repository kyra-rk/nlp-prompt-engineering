i'm here--so far--and starting on again.,2
and heavy as the dead.,0
i would not live alway,2
beneath thy gracious feet!,1
"whom phoebus taught unerring prophecy,",2
"""as the gods would i see,"" said sigurd, ""though death light up the land.""",3
"what i have heard,",2
"all right,' says t'other, 'only step round smart;",2
"through the salt sea foam,",2
playmates' glad symphony.,1
and ever a thrill in mine inmost heart,1
like morning glory,1
would we were bidden with the rest!,2
"o, i can ne'er forget",2
abloom by sacred streams,1
and keep my senses straightened,2
"flew to and fro,",2
your paynim heroes faster ride,1
"when thee, the eyes of that harsh long ago",0
"then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:",2
then to tell.,2
"we hear our mother call from deeps of time,",2
"we're perishing and blind!""",0
"so neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen",2
"thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,",1
and so i should be loved and mourned to-night.,3
make a fragrance of her fame.,1
the hostile cohorts melt away;,3
"""it is a lie, a damned, infernal lie!""",0
"o, mind ye, luve, how aft we left",2
o that i were where helen lies,2
"sometime, when all life's lessons have been learned,",2
and i am still the same;,2
but now for me than you—the other way.,2
"the play is done,--the curtain drops,",2
"and match, and bend, and thorough-blend, in her colossal form and face.",2
“why won’t the farm next to it do for you?”,2
let the scared dreamer wake to see,2
"or at the church, she ever bore herself",2
with which his house is haunted;,0
"far from the woods where, when the sun has set,",2
that in their holes abed at close of day,2
"all hastening onward, yet none seemed to know",2
"she falls back from the freedom she had hoped.""",2
"and raised their eyes above,",2
"concerning him ye wot of, thus to think",2
and never be forgot in mighty rome,1
"and so,",2
"nathless, as hath been often tried,",2
"the meadows mine, the mountains mine, --",2
who felt your own thought worthy of record,1
"turn'd back the shafts, and mock'd the gates of death,",0
"and changing like a poet's rhymes,",2
"i feel the road unroll,",2
"dey kin talk from hyeah to yandah,",2
"like your nest,",2
the pyramids have risen.,2
"leading downward to the river,",2
"he stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;",0
’tis to behold his vengeance for my son.,0
"then thro’ his breast his fatal sword he sent,",0
"burns in thee, child?--what good can thee betide,",2
as childhood's sweet delight.,1
swifter far than youth's delight--,1
"behind the sea-wall's rugged length,",2
"even while we gaze, though it awhile avail",2
"his days in peace; but his straight lips were bent,",3
"that you or yours, having an appetite,",2
i'm always thinkin' long.,2
with ten picked archers of my train;,2
so runs the perfect cycle of the year.,1
"how weak this tinkling line,",0
"three lives, three strides, three foot-prints in the sand;",2
"best gems of nature's cabinet,",1
when the glance hast lost its beam;,0
"and brief related whom they brought, wher found,",2
"some come ridin' in top-buggies wid de w'eels all painted red,",2
he might have been as doubtful once,2
"but i, or any demmercrat, feels comf'table to stan' on,",2
"that thou should'st smile again?""--the evening came,",2
abominations; and with cursed things,0
she still must keep the locket to allay,2
lift their blue woods in broken chain,2
"are angel faces, silent and serene,",1
to his ears there came a murmur of far seas beneath the wind,2
"and thus each tint or shade which falls,",2
i can see how you might. but i don't know!,2
sent by an hand unseen;,2
"but now i see, most cruell hee,",0
where its first shadow casts the holy mountain;,2
"sooner, augustine, sooner far, shall i",2
"fit for an abbot of theleme,",2
"may meditate a whole youth's loss,",0
is lovely round; a beautiful river there,1
have i played in different countries.,2
"of your strong and pliant branches,",1
"yearns to its source. the spirit thirsts for god,",2
"except in france; and when it’s found in france,",2
down in the west upon the ocean floor,2
"unconscious of the passing troop,--",2
"and that unrest which men miscall delight,",3
endymion would have passed across the mead,2
the poet comes the last!,2
"how over, though, for even me who knew",2
"""i say it's someone passing.""",2
"""is this a nightmare, or am i",0
"a thousand rubs had flattened down each little cherub's nose,",2
the wood giant,2
in some lady's gyahden.,2
"a wagon, overarched with evergreen,",2
of brynhilda's love and the wrath of gudrun.,3
"push every outpost nearer,",2
"her scutcheon shows white with a blazon of red,--",2
ef zeke had be'n the bigges' man,2
i think i'll just call up my wife and tell her,2
"they were wet, and glistened with raindrops, shed",2
less often man--the harder of the two.,2
to hold it fast.,2
"the soul with sweetness, and like an adept",1
that to the next i may resign my roome,2
"shall part, yet link, thy nature's tone and mine.",2
(thy kingdom come) with his revealéd face,2
tis that one told us it was life. 'for not,2
"shall yet be glad for him, and he shall bless",1
"uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.",1
three trojans tug at ev’ry lab’ring oar;,2
"his regal seat, surrounded by his friends.",1
"there is nothing to hope for, i am tired,",0
a tyrian colony; the people made,2
"sometimes towards heav'n and the full-blazing sun,",1
gay little heart!,1
"how hearts were answering to his own,",1
"would split, for size of me.",2
"""play uppe, play uppe, o boston bells!",1
she sought for flowers,2
in every health we drink.,2
"the love that lived through all the stormy past,",3
and leaves the world to darkness and to me.,0
"for her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,",1
"of common, natural things a part,",2
my father’s sister started when she caught,2
"and, waking, find it vision,--none the less",2
to his aid the strong reverses,2
the likeness of the wood's remembered leaves.,2
kneeling ne'er spoiled silk stockings; quit thy state;,0
and very venus of a pipe.,2
"i look up from this page of thine,",2
with the _quart d'heure_ of rabelais!,2
they had not set there. who had set it there?,2
"""sorry?  of course you are, though you compress,",2
her thoughts are like the lotus,2
to make a body curse.,0
"some thought of me, a last fond prayer",1
and yet its whole career,2
"let those whom nature hath not made for store,",2
of my wit or in my mind,2
"amidst the gold and the purple, and the pillows of his bed:",2
midway the floor (with thatch was it strewn) burned ever the fire-flame,2
"love works at the centre,",2
of things that only children see,2
"and so on. then a worthless gaud or two,",0
"from kindling spark struck out from dead king's brow,",3
his sweeter voice a just accordance kept.,1
"they beached their galley on the shore, and sought",2
sang as little children sing;,2
"with its chang'd countenance, is sent away",2
"of the bivouac fire apart,",2
"let us do our work as well,",2
"betrayed how mightily its heart was stirred,",3
with the freedom of lakes and lands.,1
"of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch’d",2
mere raft of stone;,2
and sate as thus upon that slope of lawn,2
"pride of thy sex, miss harriet martineau!",1
"crouching and sleeping neath its grassy lair,",2
to touch such goodness with a grimy palm.,3
"to paris, and you make no sign at all.",2
"our hope, our remembrance, our trust,",1
and make the liveliest monkey melancholy.,0
the message is not like what i have learned,2
"the limpid ocean mirrors all the stars,",1
"weak, timid, homesick, slow to understand",0
"ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers,",2
the habitable earth is full of bliss;,1
you heard the news from vincent carrington.,2
ere i own an usurper i'll couch with the fox;,2
bedaubed with iridescent dirt.,2
fearless but weary to thy arms i creep;,3
and bow to dread inquisitor and worship lords of dust;,0
who wrote this modest version i suppose,2
"a crow dot sat a-squawkin', ""i's a mockin'-bird.""",2
to me that time did not appeire:,2
"reasoning to admiration, and with mee",1
"hear its low inward singing,",2
"what though the claret circled well,",2
none will forget it till shall fall the deadly dart!,0
"the eternal law,",2
so that ye for them are made,2
"begins, but endeth nevermore;",2
"why write i still all one, ever the same,",2
o'er sweet profounds where only love can see.,1
"i see two boats with nets, lying off the shore of paumanok, quite still;",2
"passing to lap thy waters, crushed the flower",0
where the warm life we cannot see--,1
but if thou do thy best,2
"grander, nobler, than that pilot",1
"halcyons of memory,",1
"and that is why, the lonesome day,",0
around thy place of slumber glowing!,1
but because she stept to her star right on through death,3
"but, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,",0
"in a dell mid lawny hills,",2
"euryalus stood list’ning while he spoke,",2
"from the slaughtering of my offspring, and the spoiling of my land;",0
thy hands all cunning arts that women prize.,1
"plucked from the death, wilt thou repay me thus?",3
"listening, with half-suspended breath,",2
"counts his nectars -- enters,",2
"and hold the hours as joshua stayed the sun,--",2
"while i, ... i built up follies like a wall",0
