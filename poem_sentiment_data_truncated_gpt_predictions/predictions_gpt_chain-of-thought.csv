a orn'ment o' saciety, in my approprut spear:","The text ""a orn'ment o' saciety, in my approprut spear:"" appears to be informal and somewhat difficult to interpret due to potential typographical errors or unique phrasing. However, breaking it down, ""orn'ment"" could imply something decorative or ornamental, and ""saciety"" might suggest society or social context. ""Approprut"" could be interpreted as ""appropriate,"" and ""spear"" might refer to a tool or symbol of power.

**Reasoning:** The phrase suggests a sense of gratitude or acknowledgment for the opportunity that studying provides (which leans positive), as it implies that the speaker values their current situation (""i never 'd ha' ben here"").
