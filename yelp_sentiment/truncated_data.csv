I'm so glad my friends told me to go here!! Wow the customer service Mike is AWESOME!!! I had the A/C installed wrong from another shop and I took it to them they fixed it right up!! The A/C works great!! \nThey next day to took them my other truck again Mike took care of everything he called to keep me informed. I know that my family now has a trusted shop to go to that is very professional. I like that it is family owned too! Thank you McFall's you help take a lot of stress away!!!!,1
"I was really looking forward to trying this place and when I finally did, I was disappointed. First things first, the food was average and expensive for what they offer. Granted this is a tourist spot, so the pricing is to be expected. I wouldn't recommend taking your kids here. This is basically the \""""German experience\"""" of drinking and having fun with a little food thrown in. The beer hall smells terrible, like stale beer and sweat. Gross.\n\nNow, on to the more important item. The service was so-so and my waiter tried to cheat me when we paid the bill. If you read nothing else in this review, read this - NEVER leave a cash tip if paying by card at this place! I charged our dinner, but left a cash tip and the waiter chased us down in the parking lot saying that he accidentally charged our card twice. This was a complete lie because while he went back inside with my card, I checked my bank app and it showed the exact amount I signed for on the receipt. He came back out a few minutes later and we went on our way. The next day I checked the bank and noticed the charge from the HB was for a higher amount and NOT the amount I signed for on the receipt. I called the HB and spoke to a very nice young lady in the accounting department who handled this whole mess after the fact. I sent her a copy of my signature and what do you know, it did not match the receipt. Hence, this waiter assumed I was a tourist visiting Las Vegas and not a resident, and he figured he could just steal from me and I wouldn't do anything about it. He took my generous cash tip and then tried to steal more money from me by charging my card for an second tip. It took nearly TWO WEEKS of my calling the HB to get the amount that I was owed refunded to me. This waiter committed fraud and, at the very least, should have been FIRED. That didn't happen. They told me that they've never had problems with him. Yeah, well, just because actual tourists don't complain when they sober up doesn't mean it isn't happening. He tried to steal from me and he'll try to steal from you too.\n\nMy overall suggestion is to avoid this place, but if you feel you just have to have the experience, pay with cash only.",0
"I didnt know \""""sh*tty wok\"""" from south park existed but this is it. Come here and enjoy theyre incredibly low quality food with their incredibly high quality decor. \n\nWe got the calamari and pad thai. Calamari tasted like it was defrosted, left out, then slightly heated up. Rubbery and greasy texture. I thought it was funny how badly i got ripped off. I kept telling my girlfriend in a sarcastic chinese manager voice \""""haha you stupid idiot pay $40 dollar for sh*@&$ food\"""". Good thing im rich and don't care about costly mistakes like this. This place should be ashamed!",0
I was looking for a pizza delivery place w/ more of a gourmet spin. I ordered a 1/2 sausage/bacon & 1/2 tomato/basil. The cheese had such a great taste that I liked the simple basil/tomato more. They have some good specials and the garlic knots/zeppolis are cheap and come w/ tons of bite size pieces great for sharing!,1
Solid breakfast food.,1
"I can understand how this location can get some extra points for being quaint  but it will certainly not get points for being clean.  The soda I had was great but I could not get over how dirty and run down this place was.  The staff where inattentive and to be honest completely useless, the tile on the floor was pealing off, the bar looked very warn and the booth we sat in was sticky. I understand the concept but I cannot forgive dirt when I visited a location.   I won't be back again.",0
"So I've been here twice now, the other time being around three or four months ago. Each time I've gone in here, I get the turkey wrap, which is pretty good. I don't find that they skimp too, too much. My only complaint, and why they're getting two stars from me is for the atmosphere. As other yelpers have said, there is a ton of tables in there! Some clean, some dirty. Booths are rickety and could seriously use some attention other than just being wiped down. The worst, worst thing of all is that (I don't know if it's just me) but each one of the two times I've gone in there, it smells so, so badly of bad odor. Just armpit stank all up in your nostrils. Trust me, I know the difference between onion and food smells and bodily fumes. This location has some seriously unpleasant aromas going on, and I'd definitely want to know what's up with that and hope they fix it if I decide on going there sometime in the future.",0
We went here for a New Years eve party. We assumed it was going to be more relaxed and mature since it was located north and away from its Old Town counterpart The place was entirely full of guys. Our group consisted of couples and it was irritating as several drunk guys kept trying to approach our significant others. I can't say I blame those guys and I felt bad for them as well since they paid a lot of money to attend this party and meet women and there were none. It eventually turned into another Scotsdale club scene. It was not classy. The dance floor was claustrophobic.,0
"NOT CLOSED THANK GOODNESS THAT IS A YELP ERROR! Still in biz at a faaabulous new location bigger and better than before - still the BEST Zumba classes in town - if you haven't had a Zumba class from Serina or Ryan, you haven;t had a Zumba class! And check out the Real Ryder classes if you like to spin - a whole new slant (pun intended - the bikes actually move from side to side giving you a whole body and core workout all at once.) And now they have room for retail so you can get your wardrobe workout in too! Love this place and cannot say enough great things about it!",1
"My wife and I were very excited about trying this place as we had heard and read some pretty good reviews. I am from the south and I knew exactly what red hots are. My wife, from Michigan, was thinking they were just regular dogs.\nI had a red hot with sourkrought, chili, onions, and cheese. My wife had all but the krought.\nNeither of us were overly impressed. While they were good, they just didn't jump out at you. The chili was so-so (could use some spiciness), and the red hots were pretty lame. \nThis is a great idea for a restaurant, but it really needs to be kicked up a bit. There was simply nothing that would draw me back. Sorry.",0
"I really like this place. Was staying in the Plaza Hotel and discovered Island Sushi and Hawaiian Grill. Since I lived for a year on Oahu the Hawaiian part caught my interest, but would it be good? I've been to places that claimed to be Hawaiian before and have been disappointed. Not the case with this place. Hawaiians work here. Always a good sign if you're going to eat authentic food from any region to have folks from that region working there. On my first visit I tried a Poke' bowl with avocado. It was very good. I think the Poke' I had in Hawaii was better, but this wasn't bad and certainly the best I've had outside the islands. On my second visit I had the Kalua Pig and cabbage. This is a true test as most say they make Kalua Pig and fail. The Pig here was good and tasted the most like the Hawaiian version I've had since I left Hawaii. Went back for a third visit and had the Poke' bowl again, good again. Same for the fourth visit. Another test is the POG juice, Pass-O-Guava that is, and in Hawaii they have two brands, Hawaiian Sun and Aloha Maid. The first is the good stuff and the second not so much, but cheaper, so when I asked which brand and they said Hawaiian Sun I knew they cared about quality and authenticity at this establishment. Would I go back? Heck, I went back three more times after the first visit and it wasn't just because I was staying at the Plaza. I had my car with me. I could have gone anywhere. Yet I went here. What does that tell you?\n\nPS: They have all you can eat sushi for $29.99 at lunch and $34.99 at dinner. Plus they have the Moco Loco challenge if you dare to try. Better be hungry though as only two have made the goal on that one.",1
I am very sad I didn't check yelp. I hired this company to get rid of bees. I asked ahead of time if they guaranteed their work and they said yes. The price I was told would range between 145-195. They removed the bees and told me it would be another 400 to take out the honey comb which I was not told up front . They charged 195 and I still have a yard full of bees. I do not recommend them. They are not honest up front and apparently don't care if the job gets done. My next stop is better business bureau.,0
"OK, let me start by saying that my preferred Theater is Harkins... I am a very 'thrifty' person and rarely we go out without using a coupon or some kind of promotional prices.\nI buy Harkins tickets in bulk and I can take a family of 4 to the movies with popcorn and drinks for $30-34.\n\nThat said, we occasionally go to AMC, and each and every time I cannot believe they can get away with those prices, particularly the concessions, not offering regular student discounts, etc...\n\nHowever, I understand that you get what you pay for, and for some this is the place and environment they want regardless of the price.\n\nBack to the actual review : )\n\n* Hubby drinks industrial amounts of diet coke, so the small glass cup that we got when we got ther was the first... \""""what?\"""" It looks and feels like a bar.. (is it a bar?) so it seems appropriate to tip your server, so for more than we were expecting to pay we got a glass full of ice that hubby finished in a couple of sips : P\n\n* Once we were seated, it seems it took a long time for a server to come and take our order... perhaps like 30 minutes or so?\n\n* I didn't think the menu options were that attractive, someone in a review compared the place to Chili's and I kind of agree with that... I am not a big fan of Chili's though...\n\n* We decided to share a chicken/chipotle quesadilla... which was good and the portion was generous. If you ask me, the sauce was a little too sweet, but oh well... It was OK.\n\n* It seems to me the dish comes with a side (chips were pictured), and while taking our order our server asked \""""Chips or fries?\"""", at the end we had an extra charge for choosing fries. I understand if there is a charge, but I believe servers should make you aware at the time you place your order. Something like... \""""It comes with chips, would you like fries for an additional charge?\""""\n\nUp until this, it would have been 3 stars, but...\n\n*I didn't think the seats were that comfortable... they didn't seem to recline and the angle was kind of weird.\n\n* Honestly, I thought the place was nasty. The small tables have some metal pieces and are not flat, obviously this makes them tricky to clean but that is not an excuse. They had marks of being poorly wiped, there were crumbs on my area, even garbage and a cherry stem in my cup holder... \n\n* Over 30 minutes - Over 30 minutes it took for my husband to get a refill for his drink...\n\n* And, my pet peeve... pop corn bags were not full, they were about or more than an inch below the edge or the bag. Argggghhh...\n\n* This must have been a very nice and impressive experience when everything was brand new... not now, not for us.\n\nDisclaimer - I attended a free screening here, so I did not really get the 'full price paying customer' experience, however, I think that should not make a difference. OR even worse, I would be even more disappointed if I had to pay admission on top of what we spent.\n\nOn the bright side, this area is very nice to go for a walk after your movie, if you go on the evenings : )",0
"I have been to this office a couple of times and was holding off on writing a review just so that I could give an accurate review of my experience. \n\nOn my first prenatal visit I felt like I was literally dying! I had lost 10lbs and could not keep any fluids or food down. I was seen by Ingrid, and My husband and I  just wanted to take her home with us. She's so positive, explained everything thoroughly and with an amazing attitude. We were able to listen to our babies heartbeat and take some ultrasound images home. As well as a prescription for dissolvable nausea pills that are STILL saving me till now. \n\nI'm now in my second trimester and stand by everything I have said after meeting our doctor, Dr.Oland! He truly is amazing he answers your questions as if he's never been asked before, which we all know he has a billion times. No question is too \""""dumb\"""" so it made me feel very comfortable. \n\nAnd of course like mentioned before the front staff isn't always the friendliest (only one individual) but the doctors and nurses even the Sonoran Quest lady are worth visiting this office. Keep up the good work!",1
4 out of 5 stars due to the physical logistics of the space alone. otherwise 5 stars. the food is always fresh & tasty. the bakery is delish! if it wasn't such a frustrating & cramped place to get a table and eat at - it would be perfect.,1
"We went on a Saturday afternoon, the decor was inviting. The staff wasn't  as friendly as some places we have been. However, they were not rude or anything. Just not overly friendly.The Rolls are good sized portions and the sauces are really yummy. Food overall was great!!!!!!",1
I decided to refinance my home. I was told that my documents would be emailed to me.  The email never arrived OfficeMax kept my documents for 2 days.   someone took the information from those documents and decided to write checks against my account now I'm dealing with identity theft.  I have never had issues with officemax and I have been going there for years but I must warn others please stay away.,0
You have to try the French toast.  They make it with challah bread! What more do you need to know?  \n\nThis place is light and airy.  Actually part of the dining room is outside which is perfect for Phoenix.  We were here a week ago Saturday and while the place was busy our waitress was attentive without hovering.  \n\nThe coffee is also very good but you do not get unlimited refills. (This is not the worst thing in the world but unlimited refills is kinds of standard for coffee.),1
Great for drinks after a long day of meetings and in the morning the breakfast  offers traditional morning fare with speedy service. \nO\nI recommend the duck confi eggs Benedict or the croque madam.,1
okay food either over seasoned or not seasoned enough,0
"The best gyros in town by far. A nice quiet place to get lunch and get caught up on some espn. If you like spicy stuff, try the gyro picado.",1
"Bad service! Waited over an hour and all we ordered desert. Ruined my friends bday! Had over ten people and they only brought out six plates. At first they didn't even bring plates. We was so hungry we started to eat food that we had in our bags and the manager swiftly ran out and yelled at us. But still no desert! No bueno, no plates, no desert and we still waiting for the check. Ordered the $93 treasure chest desert and it was mushy and not good. Would never come here again!!",0
"Important - this store in INSIDE THE HARRIS TEETER. \n\nConvenient if you are already a shopper, but parking is not always easy to find if you are just trying to get a quick coffee and be on your way.\n\nThey do have a lot of seating though, so if you plan to stay a while and work or read or something, they have a great patio area and a lot of inside seating as well.\n\nThe barista's in here are very nice. I only come here when I am already grabbing something from the market though.",1
"Not a big ramen fan, but I really liked this place - food, atmosphere, service and reasonable prices. A great find.",1
"FYI, get the pan roast at less mild to medium spice. I tried it very mild due to sharing it with a friend that doesn't care for spicy. But wow, the flavor was totally different. I'm definitely not going to knock down a star for that. I wish the lines weren't so long! I've stopped by 3-4 times now, and each time the wait looks to be 45+ minutes, so i had to pass :(\n\nBut i can't wait to eat it again!",1
"Once per year a group of friends and I hit this place up because the food is delish. \n\nThis year, king crab legs, shrimp, oysters,  and a phat Rib Eye was screaming my name.\n\nGoodness gracious I love this place! I will return for more red meat! \n\nCheers, \n\nBig O",1
"The head  baker here is a bad  mutha--shut yo mouth!!! \nI was referred here by an unnamed source who decided they'd had enough of me and my so called diet and boy was this a diet buster\nFirst off, the thing that impressed me out of nowhere was the tres leches. Usually buying tres leches from somewhere other than a Mexican bakery usually ends in a sugary wet disaster, but when they pulled it off, I knew we could be in business\n\nThe cream of the crop, at least to me were the mini pies. I always love eating pies by myself so making one smaller was only the next logical step, and I must say it almost brought a tear to my eye. Me and my food brother took bites out our pies and then gave each other that look that only a fellow secret food beast will understand. Needless to say those pies went off to the great bakery in the sky\nLong story short, get here, eat some pastries then walk out like a boss",1
Twice in the past year I have had a small business function catered by Nando's and I remain extremely impressed with their outstanding food and service.  DELICIOUS!!  Reasonably priced.  I will definitely order Nando's again for our next function.,1
"i have visited the restaurant on a couple occasions prior to my latest lunch dinning experience and the previous times were not memorable enough good or bad to express an opinion. However my latest experience i have felt compelled to share my thoughts. as we arrived on a saturday after visiting a friend in the area for her graduation party, the atmosphere was of an average weekend gathering with maybe a little bigger crowd than usual. The 3 people i was with ordered a wrap, an omelette, and my original burger medium. had a couple 2 dollar mimosas and began to wait for 1 hour and 30 minutes to be served. now maybe it had to do with the large amount of families or maybe this is a common expectation for a weekend lunch either way i felt this was too long. the kicker is when i received my dry well well done burger i laughed and asked the waiter if they could take it back and and just cancel my order.\nthe wator replied i would be glad to take it back and see if the cook can make you a new order medium done as he agreed this burger was well overcooked. I replied with the fact i am not willing to wait another hour but thanks for the offer. the only good that came out of this was that i am now reassured that my home cooking grass fed beef is not comparable to a restaurant broiler!",0
"This was probably the worst bojangles I've ever been to.  First traffic makes getting in and out hard and when you do get inside you see a store that doesn't look like it's had a major cleaning or remodel in years.  I'm the only customer there is I go to the register and service was pretty apathetic with a hint of ghetto attitude for making them work.\n\nI get my order and see that all the tables are dirty and the floor hasn't been cleaned so it's a game of find the least nasty. Sit down and the sandwich is overcooked to the point of being rubber.  The fries were pretty average so I ate quickly and left, no point in trying to get that mess fixed.",0
"My friends and I were in Montreal for the weekend, and we decided to check out Montreal's Chinatown. It was around 5pm on Saturday, and after walking around for a bit, we decided we were hungry and wanted dinner. It was hard to tell which of the restaurants were good, since it was too early for the restaurants to be crowded, and some of them looked sketchy from the outside. We eventually settled on Mon Shing. \n\nWe ordered spring rolls, fried wontons, yang chow fried rice (pork & shrimp), beef with chinese broccoli, mapo tofu (tofu with pork, scallions and spicy sauce) and 1L of the house white wine. The wine came out first, and was actually really delicious, and only $22. The food came out quickly and was good. Not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but definitely good. There was SO MUCH food. We finished the appetizers, wine and broccoli, but left half the fried rice and 3/4 of the tofu. It was all really delicious- we just couldn't finish it. With our check, they gave us 8 slices of oranges and 3 fortune cookies. Yummy! The meal took just the right length of time, and as we were leaving, there was a decent line of people waiting to be seated.\n\nDefinitely go if you're hungry and looking for solid, cheap Chinese food. With tip, the meal cost us about $20 each for a liter of wine and more food than we could eat!!",1
"I agree with the previous posters.  I stopped here when I was in the neighborhood to get gas and there is no pay at the pump.  I had to go inside, tell the woman how much I wanted pumped, show her my ID for the credit card, swipe and then pay.\n\nI will drive by this place in the future.  The set up is just plain dumb and this station aptly earns its name.",0
"This  cart is bold.  Really bold.   They serve a variety of sliders, but bypass the familiar (and often grand) burger slider.  Even bolder, they hauled everything over to Science Dr., which can be a wasteland for like operations.\n\nThey can get away with it because it is obvious, based on their menu, they step their sliders up a whole 'nother level.  Everything (even the vegetarian options) read so appetizing.  The dribbles were making my way to my chin.  It would be embarrassing, but  I'm sure they see it all the time. \n\nTheir service was very friendly and efficient.  My order was styrofoamed in two minutes.\n\nI was in the mood for Italian, but also wanted something spicy to battle my sinuses. I opted for two mix/match sliders and chips combo.  The sliders were; \""""Powerball\"""" - homemade marina-soaked juicy meatball stuffed with gooey mozzarella with deliciously fresh basil leaves floating in the sauce & \""""Italy on Wisconsin\"""" -- a roma tomato and fresh mozzarella slice topped with the basil, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Too finish it off, I had to snag the handmade thick-cut potato chips with garlic wasabi!  \n\nThe meatball slider was perfect old school Italian-American with a touch of class stepping it up with basil and perfectly oozing mozzarella.  Even better was the incredible \""""Italy on Wisconsin\"""" - AKA 'Caprese Salad on a Bun\""""; I never thought that it could work so well, but it was, so fresh and saliva inducing, I wanted more!  Of course their buns are perfect (don't say that in the wrong company)!  Finally, I finished with the chips.  There was a massive mound of perfectly crispy, crunchy and salted real potato-ey goodness.  The wasabi sauce was sinus-clearing and delicious -- the garlic was a light undercurrent, but added to its robust flavor. \n\nThe budget gourmet lunch was only $8.00!  It was certainly more satisfying than grabbing a Pop Tart from vending or walking further for a bland sub or a slice of grease-drenched pizza.  \n\nYou gotta have this.  I will go as many times as they will return to Science Dr.  I'm almost certain that I'll love everything they offer.",1
"Love this place. Food is always amazing and the service is great. They have great salads and portions are gigantic. Just avoid going here on weekends in the wee hours because you'll be surrounded by drunk, half naked girls and douchy guys that just got out of the clubs. Unless you want to see girls walking around shoeless and guys fist pumping to imaginary bass sounds.",1
"Blissful Yoga Studio went out of business within several days of me purchasing a five class a package for my mother. Upon contacting the studio-- which never returns phone calls or emails-- on a repetitive amount of occasions, the studio finally agreed to issue a full refund within 48 hours. This assurance and guarantee of reimbursement has yet to be fulfilled after almost 2 weeks.\n\nI have never encountered a business that values its customers in such a manner (not a compliment in the slightest). I will continue to pursue Blissful Yoga Studio until I have received my full refund for the unused five class package I purchased in January. \n\nA completely counter-reproductive, irritating, and surreal experience.",0
"Deuce, tell your waitresses if they won't acknowledge your female patrons then your female patrons won't return.  We arrived to a semi-empty lounge at 1am and seated ourselves in the middle of the lounge.  We waited and waited...20 minutes passed with zero services from the waitresses who were all over the other predominantly male tables.  We decided to leave rather than beg for service.  No thanks.  Never again.",0
"...not so good....the $14 cocktail, described as \""""savory\"""" was really sweet and not very cold.  My husband had the surf and turf tasting menu, and I had the vegetarian tasting menu.   He loved the caviar opener, while I thought the arugula salad was nothing special and vinegary.  Husband's 2nd course was the lobster pot pie, their signature dish, generous portion but alas the lobster tail was tough and over cooked, he chewed and chewed and chewed each bite, rendering conversation difficult.. Meanwhile my 2nd course consisted of four tiny tortellini swimming in an sea of over powering, sweet red pepper sauce.  I dissected them in half but still ate them in a blink while he continued masticating the rubbery lobster.  His 3rd course was kobe beef....again, tough and chewy!  My third course was a discordant, Japanese inspired hodgepodge...a spoonful of sticky rice, two baby bok choy, a round of daikon, two battered mushrooms and a bowl of vinegary sauce...each item was well prepared, but still a dish that would have been disappointing at 1/4 of the price.\n\nWe both liked the desserts.  I applaud them for having a vegetarian tasting menu at all.\n\n\nMaybe it was an off night in the kitchen.",0
"Dear fro yo gods--thank you for finally planting yourself Uptown! My co-worker told me that she wanted some ice cream today and I promptly said \""""Hey, let's try The Frozen Isle, the new fro yo place\"""" and couldn't have been happier. No longer do I have to go to Cold Stone or La Harris Teeter when I'm having a cold craving, I can just walk across the street to the Overstreet Mall!\n\nLike some of my favorite fro yo places, you pay by the ounce so if you want something little, you can get a small portion or if you're having a bad day in corporate America, you can gorge! They have 10-12 different flavors ranging from fruity ones like strawberry, raspberry, pineapple to more decadent ones like french vanilla, banana cream, dark chocolate. The toppings rock as well--fresh fruit! None of that sugary fruit mix from a can that's swimming in syrup but fruit like blackberries, kiwi, blueberries and strawberries at their peak. And to top it all off-Ghirardelli syrups like caramel and chocolate plus they have punch cards that you can get punched for each visit, oh yeah!!\n\nSo I guess I need to add a \""""Frozen Isle\"""" budget along to my coffee budget each week? I think I can swing that!",1
"I heart shoes and I heart Winners... naturally I heart Winners with awesome shoe sections even more!!! \n\nSpent 1 hour in the shoe section alone and found lots of fantastic options. The rest of the store didn't really do anything for me, but I did manage to find a cute LBD for $16.\n\nSorry boys but the mens section here seemed to be lacking a bit.",1
"Arrogant Butcher continues to disappoint.  I came here on Friday to celebrate someone's birthday.  The pretzel/fondue appetizer was awesome, as always, but I'm beginning to suspect that it's the only good thing on the menu -- and really, that's not very impressive because how could they possibly mess up salted bread and melted cheese??\n\nWe were headed to the art museum after dinner, so I decided to order an appetizer for my meal since I knew I couldn't finish a whole entree and I didn't want to lug leftovers around with me on the lightrail.  At first I ordered the steamed mussels, but sadly they were out of them for the night.  My second choice was the salmon rillette, which the menu described as \""""smoked salmon with crusty bread.\""""  I was expecting a lox and french bread type of plate, but what came out was smoked salmon that had been mushed up into little chunks, soaked in some sort of liquid (tasted like vinegar maybe?), poured in a jar and topped with many capers.  I gave it a try and spread it on the bread, but after 2 bites I knew I did not like it.  it was mushy and sour and yecchh.\n\nI was waiting for the bartender (we sat at the bar) to come by and ask if we enjoyed our food so that I could exchange my salmon for a salad or something, but she never did.  she only came at the end of our meal and collected my plate (still FULL of food except for the 2 bites missing) and threw all the food in the trash.  you would think the plate full of uneaten food would've clued her in that I didn't enjoy my meal, but either she didn't notice or didn't care, but just brought out the check and gave it to us without comment.  I didn't want to be fussy, so we paid and left.\n\nMy dining companion ordered the jambalaya for his meal and said it was really greasy.\n\nArrogant Butcher, you make me angry that you charge so much money for bleh food.  I will not be convinced to come here again, no matter how good your pretzel/fondue is!",0
"The one star is for the staff. They are cute and sweet and very on top of it. However, this is simply the most appalling food that any restaurant has ever tried to serve me. It made Denny's seem like a visit to Fouchon. It is so nightmarishly over priced and so under developed. The omelet I had was filled to bursting point with a clear greasy liquid. My friends had sandwiches where the bread was just soaked in the same curious matter, and the chicken had the consistency of asbestos. And for this, an omelette was 11 bucks, and a sandwich is 13. The southwest scramble was filled with super cheap greasy chorizo and tasted like scrambled eggs with a canned sloppy joe mix thrown in, vegetables were frozen, of course. Shocking. This really is a new very dark development for Las Vegas. It used to be that you could arrive here and get a decent meal and a room for cheap so you could spend all your money on gambling. Now, everywhere you turn, you are being nickel and dimed and overcharged to such an embarrassing level that you simply want to go home and just spend your money doing something really fulfilling there. Planet Hollywood is so douchey that you may actually feel in danger crossing through the casino, it looks like a bunch of wife beaters hunting for their next victims. Skip this place AT ALL COSTS.",0
I got fish and chips and its tasteless rubber that's been sitting under a heating lamp for what tastes like hours.,0
"I saw Caci for my first eyebrow waxing when I was 15 and never looked back!  I'm now 23 and living elsewhere and miss her treatment so much that when I visit home, my vacation practically revolves around her availability.  I haven't found anyone that does my eyebrows as well as she always does! Caci's incredible knowledge of all things skincare and her experience has led me to recommend her to all of my friends and follow her to the different salons where she has worked over the past several years.

Seriously the $60 burger is the WORST burger I've ever had. The foie was greasy and overly gamy and NOT SEASONED AT ALL! The rest of the burger was also not seasoned. I doubt that was wagyu beef - it was super dry and flavorless. Nothing about this burger warrants $60.\n\nThe lamb burger was excellent. I ordered provolone (I think it was provolone) cheese for my lamb burger. Probably one of the BEST burgers I've ever had in my life!\n\nThe zucchini fries tasted like nothing and I think are frozen / bulk but can't be sure. \n\nService was not great. I will never go back.,0
"Terrible customer service.\nEnter store, go to Ipod location.\nEmployee Nick looks at me.  Says nothing.\nI say I need an Ipod Classic.\nHe tilts head toward his microphone and calls for a key to open the case.\nOpens case, removes Ipod, nods toward cash register.\nAsks if I am part of some rewards program (he mumbled so I'm not sure what program he was asking about)\nRings up sale.  Tells me the amount.\nI pay.  He pushes item towards me then says 'Do you want a bag?'\nI wait for him to say thank you. . . not happening, he never says another word.  \nI say 'You're welcome'\nEnd of transaction.\n\nHello Fry's Electronics!",0
"** O is a breathtaking show that utilizes a stage that magically fills up with water. The circus acts were elegant, albeit a tad boring. Ticket prices are high. **\n\nMy 6th Cirque Du Soleil show! \n\nI haven't written a review in over a month. Please excuse my lackadaisical behavior, Yelpers and Yelpettes, I can no longer ingest anything fried, salty, meaty, carby or sweet. Says who? My bladder. \n\nSo what's the point of living? Well... I've been asking myself that too. It's been tough kids, especially since I can't eat at yummy places. No yummy places,  means I can't write Yelp reviews. No reviews means I'm Yelpless! Ohhh... the depravity. Life in a first world country is so hard. #firstworldproblems\n\nSo... what were we talking about? Oh yes, my bladder... no wait... O. No, not that O, the show O, silly! Well kids, I can still watch shows so I'm content to just writing about shows and sex stores that I visit. O was interesting, in a blah sort of way. I think I'm officially Cirque-d out (did I just make up a word)? I've watched so many, they are getting repetitive. \n\nHere's the adjectives I'd use to describe O: beautiful, expensive, BORING, tasteful, watery, SNOOZE. Get the idea? Being my 6th Cirque show, I've already seen a version of all the acts in other shows. There's nothing new and nothing mesmerizing. The stage and the use of water is breathtaking... for about 5 mins... then it's like, \""""cool.\"""" You know what it reminds me of? The fountain show at Bellagio. It's cool the first two times you watch it, maybe a third time it holds some fascination. But for an hour and twenty minutes? No thanks. \n\nThe stage and the acts are very beautiful, similar to a well choreographed ballet. Unfortunately I find ballet boring. My favorite act were the contortionists. Three beautiful ladies contort themselves into different poses. They seem to defy gravity.\n\nSide note: this was the first Cirque show I fell asleep in. I even stayed awake during Beatles Love. If you've read my review, that's saying a lot.",1
"I love taking my baby to gymboree. It has been a great experience. I feel that it has really accelerated her development and learning. \nIt is now under new management and is undergoing changes. I will update my review again after everything settles. Miss Chris was the previous owner and was amazing. She lead every class and provided a ton of developmental information and enthusiasm. I think she will be hard to replace.\nThe best thing about gymboree was that you had unlimited classes. I could take my baby 4 days a week plus open gym for 60 something a month. They are supposed to get rid of that feature in April, if they do, then I will probably cancel my membership. I think having unlimited keeps more students in the class which enhances my babies interactions and learning. When she was in level 2, there were very few babies and most classes were empty, this made me wait to sign up for level 3, where there were more kids and more fun. Also, my work schedule keeps changing and I have different days off, it is way more convienent to pick and choose what class I go to. I do not see why it matters if you go to more than one class, the instructors still need to be there so I am not sure how they will save money. Anyways, that's just my 2 cents. I hope it stays unlimited so I have a great place to take my baby.",1
"I was visiting in LV and this was close by.  Beings I'm from a small town with few restaurants like this, I gave it a try.  I liked it!  I had a HUGE Nacho Burrito for lunch.  I went back for dinner and had one of their salads.  The salsas are really tasty.  All in all I'll be back whenever I make it back to the area.  It's on the order of Rubio's and Chipolte, which I've tried in other cities, not mine for sure........",1
"It really is a highlight of my morning to walk by this place and just have some time to relax, have a good coffee and a REALLY good pastry here.\n\nI think I might soon get addicted to their pistachio croissant. \n\nNice couch, good atmosphere, service with a smile... Wifi and cozy, what else ?",1
"This review is for the Vegas Uncorked Mother's Day Brunch.  \n\nI arrived about 25 minutes early and there was already a line almost back to the casino floor.  While we were waiting they passed out Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's.  Definitely a nice way to pass the time.  When we were seated, Food Writer Alan Richman and Chef Tom Colicchio spoke about Mother's Day and the changing face of hunger in America.  It was quite special and moving to see these esteemed professionals share such an important message. \nNow onto the food:\n\n1st Course:\nScones with Creme Fraiche and Market Preserves.  The Scones were so good I finished mine without putting anything on them!\n\nSeasonal Fresh Fruit.  A nice selection of Melons, Berries and Pineapple.\n\nPickled Farm Egg with Roasted Beets, White Anchovy.  Never thought I'd like this, but the combination of flavors was just fantastic!\n\nChilled Maine Lobster and Artichoke Salad.  I KNEW I' d like this one and I Loved it!\n\nWild Arugula with Shaved Pecorino.Standard Salad, but the cheese took it to another level.\n\nHouse Made Porchetta with Mustard Fruits. Wonderfully rich and fatty with a contrasting sweetness from the fruit.\n\n2nd Course\nBelgian Waffle with Warm Fruit Compote.  My least favorite dish of the meal.\n\nSous Vide Eggs, Asparagus, Morels, Ramps.  Stunningly delicious.  The Morels were absolutely fantastic!\n\nWagyu Skirt Steak, Salsa Verde.  Tender and Flavorful.\n\nBraised Kubuta Pork Belly.  Best Pork dish I have ever had!  It almost brought a tear to my eye.\n\nCreamed Spinach Gratin.  Just OK.\n\nDesserts(So full I only tried two.)\nFrozen Chocolate Souffle.  Rich, Creamy, Chocolatey. YUM!\n\nLemon Verbena Pavlova, Strawberry Sorbet. Light crispy shell, sorbet tasted just like fresh strawberries.\n\nThis was a fantastic dining experience. The restaurant is wheelchair accessible and based on the quality of the food and service, I will definitely return for dinner in the future.",1
"Great place to pop into for healthy lunch, I recommend takeout unless you want to watch Telenovas during your lunch, I don't.  The interior hurts my eyes, bright blue and red furniture was a little too much for me. I love Greek food, and they serve a solid chicken kabob, chicken was great and marinade was sooo flavorful! Lots of fresh vegetables served with the side salad, the rice was unusual, but good, not your typical jasmine rice which I prefer. All and all good experience.",0
"Good place to see a lot of KISS memorabilia and hear some good music, but for us, that was about it.  Mini golf was lame (but I did beat my golfer boyfriend by one stroke), there is a small arcade area (which we aren't interested in), and a wedding chapel if that's your thing. \n\nThe staff were great though!  Very fun and attentive.  We are glad we went and suggested to our friends to go at least once,. but we probably won't go back.",0
"My wife and I intended to go to a different restaurant at the same hotel, but the wait was too long. We checked out the menu and thought we'd give it a shot.  I suspect this place catches a lot of overflow, although it was not very busy when we went. \n\nImmediately upon entering you're greeted by a thirty foot Guy Fieri picture whose eyes tend to follow you, no matter where you go. Occasionally throughout the meal I made awkward eye contact with Guy. I felt judged. Seriously, it was a little weird.\n\nService: three different servers asked us if we wanted drinks, which is better than no servers asking if you want drinks, but a little bothersome. Water glasses remained full and $12 mimosa and Bloody Mary were ok. Service was attentive overall, but didn't take our app plate when the entrees came, making it a bit crowded at the table. \n\nFood: for an appetizer we had the fondue dippers. The cheese sauce was decent, but the breadsticks were more difficult to manage than food should be. Long, dry breadsticks wrapped in pepperoni and dusted with Parmesan cheese. I don't know if they put them in the oven or what, but they were lukewarm and broke easily. Kind of messy. \n\nMy wife had a Caesar salad and the dressing was not good, way too much cheese, and bland overall. It came with something called the \""""mega crouton\"""" which looked like a bread boomerang.  No joke. She could barely eat any of it. $17 Caesar salad failure.  \n\nI had the mayor of flavor town burger, or something like that. It had pastrami on the burger with Asian slaw in a pretzel bun. Came with a fry medley. This is not the kind of burger you can pick up and eat, which was what I was hoping for. If you're dressed nice and away from your hotel, handle with extreme caution. I ended up dismantling it with a fork and knife, but it still wasn't anything special. The fries were good. \n\nWe noticed some other diners having trouble with sandwiches, and I felt a little guilty when I didn't warn the table next to us when they placed their order for burgers.  We found humor in some of the decor and staff uniforms, and had a pretty good time despite the food, but your $95 with tip would be better spent elsewhere. I debated paying with cash so there would be no record we ever went there.",0
I used to order from there about 5+ times a week UNTIL I ate there with a girlfriend and a roach crawled across my food. Yes. a huge ROACH. When I showed the owner she nodded like seeing a roach isn't that abnormal. We immediety left.   On another occasion my boyfriend had what looked like a larvea in his soup. Never again. Never again.,0
"I usually love Pita Jungle ( I eat here about 4 times a week) but I will drive out of my way to avoid this location from now on.  I always order take out and the inconsistencies drive me nuts. Tonight my Mediterranean Chicken Salad was missing the golden raisins and they forgot the dressing. Last time, it was missing the cucumbers. My boyfriend always gets a side of garlic new potatoes and it has become a joke each time we pick up to see what type of container and what size they will be. We always pay the same price, but sometimes the order of potatoes is at least half the size it was the time before. Of course all of this is more frustrating because you dont realize these things until you get home. The last thing you want to do is drive all the way back to the restaraunt.  At least there are plenty of other locations to choose from because this one needs a lot of work!",0
I tried this new restaurant and here is what I found great about it. \n\nFriendly \nFast\nNot expensive\nGreat Food -- had the Rib Tickler the ribs fell right off the bone. \nThe Sauce was great!\n\nLooking forward to bringing some friends!,1
"The service here is good, but thats as good as it gets. The salsa is disgusting the food is bland and unidentifiable and its just generally annoying",0
"Here for the grand opening!\n\nThey are giving complimentary choice of Pho and pork chop, with a thai tea or soda.\n\nTheir pho broth is very \""""beefy\"""" and full of flavor.  Probably the most flavor that i have tried, but some may feel like it is slightly overpowering.  The sides and etc are fresh and delicious...tender meats.\n\nThe pork chop was very very tender...pulled apart with fork.  Very good.  Yum!\n\nService was quick and friendly.  Setting is very nice...lots of nice granite and tasteful interior tid bits...blows away most pho spots decor wise.\n\nGive it a shot!",1
"The holy grail of tacos... Believe the hype. This is the end all be all of my happiness for food. Best tacos ever, hands down. The exterior of the restaurant is a little rough looking and isn't very visible from the road. Also, I do wish the menu was more descriptive in regards to what the tacos were garnished with ect. Our food came out quickly and the service was good. Overall this was win and I can't wait to return. \n\nItems Ordered:\n(Tacos) Shrimp, chorizo, fish & crane asada \n\nCarne asada quesadilla with a side of rice and black beans.",1
"This is my second visit, both times the cashier and another guy (I think the owner) was there. They're very friendly and I asked the cashier a couple of questions regarding the milk teas and he answered it and help me made my choice! \n\nI ordered the iced milk tea with taro pudding and boba and it was yum! \n\nPrices are very reasonable and they're very generous with the boba and other toppings! \n\nI think it'd be a good idea if they start serving small snacks that goes with boba! I passed by japan creek market to get some sushi and takoyaki and it paired well with my boba. \n\nI would've bought it at qq boba if they serve something like that there too. :)\n\nThey have power bands on the side, so I purchased one too!\n\nAll in all, it was such a pleasant experience! I will definitely come back!",1
"I had made reservations for 11:00am a few days before we went to Las Vegas to make sure we did not have to wait in line.  We arrived at 10:45am in the chance we could get seated early and saw there were quite a few tables open.  There were people waiting outside to get in as they were walk-ups and had placed their name on the waiting list.  We saw table after table fill up with walk-ins, even seating a couple that had just walked up to the hostess that moment and were seated before us.  After 11:00am, I checked in with the hostess again about our request for seating outside with a view of the strip, and I was told I would be seated sahortly. Five minutes later, we were eventually seated outside with the view, which was very pleasant, along with the weather.  From that point on, the experience was great. We ordered the grilled artichoke with remoulade, an order of the pank crusted mac and cheese with truffle oil, sweet potato fries, and the double frozen hot chocolate for two.  The food was very good, much better than I expected. The artichokes were seasoned and grilled nicely, with a nice smokey flavor, and plenty of yummy dipping sauce. The macaroni was rich and decadent which the kids said was the best ever. The sweet potato fries came in this cute little [ail, and were crispy and well done.  The frozen hot chocolate was as good advertised, with whipped cream and pieces of chocolate in the drink.  The waitress service was friendly and efficient and provided our family with a great experience after a rough start.",1
"I need to get myself over to Dilly's Deli soon- I have not been in awhile.  I really liked the potato soup in the bread bowl--- wow!  SO good.  So am craving it now.  \n\nThe lunch line would get really long though, if you can avoid the lunch rush, I would and go at an off-beat hour instead.\n\nThe bread is all really good here and the prices were good too.",1
"Someone fire that Asian guy who runs the front of the house.  Terrible server who gets too comfortable with his customers.  Sushi bomb DOES NOT know how to handle big parties.   They purposely \""""forget\"""" rolls.  \n\nIt was an embarrassment bringing visitors here.  Do not come here.",0
"The Modern Art Galleries is made up of the Dean Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art, located in two separate buildings across the road from one another.\n\nThe Dean Gallery is smaller and has some interesting pieces. I was rather impressed by the big metal roboty thing which stood two stories tall. I checked the website for this, because there is not a chance I would remember it and I want to be helpful, so the Dean Gallery features Dada and Surrealism. I couldn't tell you what that is, just that I enjoyed this nicely kept, quiet gallery.\n\nThe Gallery of Modern Art is, well modern art. So I go in and think, WTF this is a room with some junk in it. Whereas someone else goes in and says \""""Aha! A masterpiece!\"""" There were many pieces where I thought, HUH? Really? That is art? But then there was some fantastic pieces with so much thought and effort put into them. One of the exhibits is a wall where this guy has added the name of every single person he has ever met to. It's not a painting but I thought it was pretty fun. This gallery is a mix of the odd and the outstandingly good and bad modern art. \n\nGreat way to spend an afternoon because it is quite entertaining and always stirs up that debate of \""""What is art?\"""" Oh and it is free.",1
Came here for happy hour after work. I got a beef fajita quesadilla and a couple of beers to was it down. \nThe quesadilla was really good. I asked for roasted jalape\u00f1os inside and extra crispy and they hit the mark. I couldn't have been happier. And pints for $2.50 isn't bad either. \nWhen I got in it was dead and 30 mins later the bar was packed. I felt bad for the only one bartender on duty.,1
"So, fact-good food (not sure where products come from?) Fact-great atmosphere. Fact-placed in a mediocre shopping center complex that looks like half of the suites are closed. If it were 1/2-3/4 mile east in the new Frys shopping center it would be an outstanding area. \n\nOverall a MUST try.",1
"My FAVORITE restaurant that I tried during my trip here. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday night for dinner before seeing KA (located right across the hallway from here). There was no wait for table, and the setting was very nice. I wore leggings and felt very underdressed, but not too out of place. \n\nService was wonderful, and the food was excellent. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and my boyfriend got the linguine with shrimp. Everything was perfect, and probably the best pasta I've ever had. \n\nDrinks were very good, and I was super happy to finally get a Moscow Mule in a copper mug! Everywhere I ordered it from never had the copper mug, but Wolfgang Puck didn't disappoint. My boyfriend ordered a Manhattan, and it was perfect. A lot of other bars we've been to tend to use cherries and tons of ice instead of orange peel with just one block of ice, but the bartender did it the right way here. \n\nI would highly recommend this place to anyone. I think it beats a long buffet line with unsanitary people grabbing food with their hands from a hot tray any day.",1
"The food is basic and the service is not good.  The waiter did not tell us what food they were out of and the kitchen just replaced that food with something different or nothing at all.  It took a long time to get drinks and chips refilled.  We had no response to our complaints about the food.  Overall, you can get this kind of food anywhere, even the grocery store.",0
"UPDATED A COUPLE MONTHS AFTER THIRD VISIT:\n\nI've lowered the stars a bit.  Had a couple coupons, so visited again.  The pasta went downhill, and on third visit, didn't even really like the pizza as much.  Service was still just okay at best.  I've moved this into the category of \""""old school\"""" Italian restaurants that aren't very upscale or authentic, but that a lot of people, especially older people, enjoy because it's very much like the 1950's or 1960's \""""Version\"""" of an Italian restaurant.  Probably deserves somewhere between 2 and 3 star.  I doubt I will be back.  It's just not my bowl of pasta.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nIt looks like a hole in the wall kind of restaurant from the street.  One lightbulb was burnt out on the sign, for example.  But once you walk in, it's an eclectic, fun blend of a 1950's \""""americanized Itallian\"""" restaurant and one of the downtown urban chic minimalist restaurants.  Very unique, very fun.  \n\nService was friendly, but the high-school aged waiter wasn't very attentive.  Water glasses were empty several times, had to flag him down after 10 minutes after meal to get the check.  So service is maybe 3 stars, possibly 2.  But I really felt that it could have just been bad luck with the waiter or possibly just a busy night.  So I'm not holding it against them too much.\n\nFood was four stars.  The complimentary appetizer \""""pizza dough\"""" bread with drizzled olive oil and spices was chewy and outstanding.  The calimari was 5 star, and would be ordered again.  The pizza margarita was terrific and large, and tasted great then and the next day for breakfast.  At $8, it was a steal, and will be ordered again.\n\nThe $14 chicken parm was hearty.   Instead of thin chicken, it was like two medium sized regular breasts breaded and deep fried, then served with shaved sheets of cheese. My wife found it salty, but I found it tasty, as did my daughter.  We struggled to finish it.  I'd give it 4 stars.\n\nMy wife ordered the mushroom Parpadelle.  It was excellent, EXCEPT for one thing... it as too al dente.  I mean, she's itallian and like al dente, but this felt like it had been boiled for about 1/2 the time.  We were in a time pressure situation, and it was still edible and tasty, so we didn't return or complain.  But clearly the chef needs to test his pasta before sending it out.  The sauce was great however.  So 2 stars, obviously.\n\nAltogether, we will be back.  I will likely order 3 pizzas for my family of four, or maybe 2 pizzas and an appetizer.  Value felt very fair.  It's not cheap food, but it's not $20 pasta entrees, and at $14 I felt fairly priced. \n\nService could be more attentive, and consistency of food could be slightly better, but I feel very comfortable with 4 stars and  a solid recommend.",0
Service was horrible and food was mediocre at best~ won't be going back,0
"They have a ton of Fat Tuesdays (and imitators) all over the Strip and casinos, and I'm so happy that's the case. Who doesn't love a dangerously innocuous-seeming yardlong slushie alcoholic beverage?\n\nMy favorites are the peach bellini, mango and strawberry. A trip to Vegas isn't complete without a yardlong girly drink. Yum.",1
"I had to pick a place to meet someone who worked nearby.  Not being from the area, I turned to Yelp for help.  \nBoy did Yelp do me right here...  this place was perfect.  GREAT staff, wonderful food, super reasonable prices, and loads of TV's.  I was there on a Friday night from 5 - 7:30 and I can't figure out why this place isn't busier.  I will be returning on my monthly business trips to PHX.  \nThey have a great happy hour that includes cheap drinks and food choices.  I really had zero complaints about this place.",1
"It was with great excitement that I visited Pig & Pickle last Saturday. I went inside with wide eyes and the enthusiasm of a child on Christmas. Something so urban and hip in my little neighborhood of South Scottsdale! Yes, please and thanks in advance.\n\nAfter dining, I am actually a little torn. There was stuff that was absolutely outstanding, and stuff that was just plain not good.\n\nI'll start with the outstanding.\n\nI personally don't really eat pork OR beef, but I figured when in Rome... I ordered the pot roast sammie, and seriously, I thought I was going to pass out from deliciousness. It tasted just like the amazing, tender pot roast that my mom used to make. It was topped with creamy cheese and caramelized onions. I'll be hard pressed to venture out and try anything new because this was just soooo good.\n\nWe also ordered desert after our meal, which if that is all I was reviewing this would be five stars without hesitation. The deserts were creative, delicious, not outrageously sized and are leaving me salivating just thinking about them. \n\nThe beer list was long, and the server was happy to offer recommendations. He was generally a friendly guy and explained the menu well when we had questions.\n\nNow for the just plain not good....\n\nUnfortunately, I have to mirror the sentiments of other reviewers and say that while very friendly, the service was poor. Wait times were long even though the place wasn't packed, and we sat with a table almost completely covered in empty dishes for most of our meal. We almost cleaned off our own table at one point just to have some room, but luckily our server eventually figured it out. I hate to say that because he was very nice, but they missed the mark on some basics of service.\n\nThe tots. I feel like I'm going to be mobbed for saying this, but to me- they weren't good at all. Maybe I was disappointed after assuming I'd get a traditional \""""tot\"""", or maybe the tot of the day wasn't my fave, but I could only manage to eat half of one.  The tot was a \""""Philly Cheesesteak\"""" and to me it was less tot and more fried mashed potato ball with peppers and steak. Not good, unfortunately. I will be totally open to trying them again in the hopes that the flavor of the day just didn't do it for me.\n\nThe cost wasn't outrageous but maybe a little high for the neighborhood. I didn't mind paying it, but some might balk at the prices.\n\nOverall, I will be back, and am looking forward to it. I just know what I'll avoid this time. Hopefully they get their service in check and get their processes streamlined. I have faith in this place, and I hope it inspires other creative, indie eateries to spring up in South Scottsdale.",1
"Great menu selection, food is hot and fresh and you can't beat the prices!",1
"DISAPPOINTMENT NAMED SALAD.  I've been going to Houston's for 23 years (I started young) and I've been getting the same dish EVERY single time.  Why?  Because it's great EVERY single time.  Never have to worry.  Except this time.\n\nI usually split the salad with someone along with the artichoke dip.  Dip = great.  Salad = Worst.  When did we change it up and add corn?   And the portion was the size of a side salad.  Side salad?  Really?  Are we that pretentious Hillstone?  And never mind about mentioning the difference of proportion to your waiter.  It doesn't go anywhere.  Which was another first.  \n\nAll in all, a Debbie Downer of a meal at the sorta new Houstons.",0
"This program is AMAZING!  The coaches are friendly, knowledgable and enthusiastic!  The facility is modern and clean plus the equipment is some of the best in the industry.  Every time I am there, I feel welcome and my kiddos have a wonderful time, burning energy, learning new skills, and most important to me, they are valued and feel special.  I would highly recommend USA Fitness to everyone from beginning athletes to elite gymnasts!",1
The prime rib is sooo onos(for da Hawaii peeps). Kid friendly. We went there about 3x and we'll go there just for the prime rib and only when we have food coupons!,1
"We got the tip from a local that the best poutine in town was here. She was so right! A bit of a wait in some bitter, bitter cold was well worth it. The food is amazing and the combinations all sound so appetizing. We also loved Poutineville, but this place is far better.",1
We thought we would try the bus  last night because we just got tired of walking. We have a show tonight on the opposite end of the strip so we we decided on a 24 hour pass. Everything would've been great had the bus driver actually stopped when we requested. We pushed the stop button as we were supposed to in plenty of time but the bus driver did not stop until 2 stops later!   People were shouting at him to stop and he refused.  When we questioned him why he did this he ignored us.  The transportation system must earn a lot of extra money if this happens on a regular basis.  We had to cross the street and take another bus back to our stop.   I would rather use a cab next time. At least their drivers that we've experienced are courteous.,0
I actually like China One's food but my family got food poisoning the last time we ate there and we've had it about 4 times. \n\nI'm pretty sad about it because they have a good variety of food and portions but me and my husband ordered the fried pork rice and we were sick for 3 days.  I was warned about the place from the girls who worked retail next door but since I had eaten there already I figured it was fine.\n\nJust a warning: There have been 6 people including me and my husband who got food poisoning from this place so I'm going to have to look for another chinese restaurant.,0
"I now have a love-hate relationship with this place. *sigh*\nThe first time I went back in 2005, I was impressed for a few reasons, the first one being that a nice, high end restaurant would be in the West Island, and that it would do well.\nSo when I planned my visit to Montreal just a few weeks ago, my sister and I decided this would be a great place to get together with my dearest MTL girls. We made plans for 20 and gave them a month's notice. No problem. 20 people, on a Friday night at 630. Awesome.\n\nLOVE.\n\nA few days before the event, they called my sister (who was the main contact since she's local), and told her that we needed to vacate by 830. \nThat's when they lost me. \nAre you EFFING KIDDING ME?! I bring you 20 people for dinner and drinks on a Friday night and you give us a two hour window?\n... it's almost as if they hate money or something.\nMy sister told them that it was ridiculous and that we couldn't do that because of potential late arrivals and you know, the fact that this place is pricey and we were putting down good money. \n\nHATE.\n\nWe arrived as scheduled and when we got there, the tables were ready to go. We were seated and everything was great as my guests started to arrive.\n\nLOVE.\n\nUntil it was time to order, when our waiters were MIA. And so went the night, highs and lows, including when the food came out fast (LOVE) and when a few guests were late, the staff asking us to consolidate tables (HATE). We did stay past our 830 \""""deadline\"""" - but as the night went on and we wanted dessert, coffee, tea, etc, it was such a pain to get a waitress (HATE).\n\nI know, I know: TL;DR -- this sums it up. If you're going to grab dinner, this place is fine. If you want to host an event here, don't. I know I won't, and neither will all of my guests who were equally unimpressed with Baton Rouge.",0
"They wanted to charge us 15% ratuity for a party of four people or less which is absolutely ridiculous. The food did look good, though. \n\nDefinitely a spot for tourists with money to burn...literally.",0
"Visited this place for a second time last night and this time I ordered some food! The first time I stopped in we were looking to play pool and enjoyed the atmosphere of the bar. It felt like I was back in college or in a local bar not one in Town Square where everyone is dressed to the nine! \n\nWe ordered chips & salsa for the start and wow, for two girls, that is a lot of chips! They cheese/bean dip was really good and we devoured it! For my main meal I ordered the Southwest Bistro Steak Salad and it tasted very good. The lettuce was crisp and the dressing and bistro sauce just made the salad. It is a vinaigrette dressing but was not overpowering, especially when I am a big ranch dressing only person! \n\nMy friend ordered the 35 shrimp, yes 35! We didn't think really you get that many shrimp...but the waiter said yep! Once it came to the table she was just in awe, 35 shrimp are a lot, haha. You even get two sides with it! She did not eat it all but she did enjoy it. \n\nThe service was awesome and our waiter was very attentive. We even got 3 glasses of wine for 2 because they didn't notice we had already been served our second glass. Yes I know its a place for beer but I just wasn't in the mood for it. \n\nOverall our experience was a great one and each of our bills came to about $20-25 dollars. I say skip Blue Martini and their fancy cheese plate and come here!",1
"Brought my dad here for dinner, as we were craving Mexican food and am glad we did! Not only did we receive top-notch service (Many thanks to our amazing waiter, Ken), but our food was so good and served in a matter of minutes from when we ordered it. And you thought only Jimmy John's served your food to you lightning fast?! \n\nKen made sure our glasses were filled, checked in on us to see how we liked our meals, and was very efficient. He also pronounced my dad's last name correctly when giving him back his credit card after dad paid the bill. That deserves kudos in my eyes right there as my family last name is hard to pronounce and hard to spell for many people, despite it only being 6 letters. \n\nI had the Baja Chimi and it was so good and filling! I will definitely order that again! \n\nGreat service + great food + great company=An outstanding experience!",1
"Love it. Been coming to the Hole in the Wall for years!. The free flowing house wine is great!\n\nThis great local spot is so comfortable in its skin, no pretense, no bravado .... Just a great atmosphere, solid service and good comfortable food. \n\nExpect a wait most nites, but grab a seat in the bar and get some wine and great starters. \n\nOh..... Come hungry!",1
"they need to shut this place down and open a wendys or something....came thursday night, nearly empty, came with 6 other people, waitress got everyones order wrong except mine...friends ordered boneless wings and came bone in they were too lazy to say anything, i asked her if she could take it back and get boneless she said its the same thing as boneless just with the bone.....FAIL",0
"Where to begin? Perhaps standing in line of 9 people and only the 1 customer service agent. This is Las Vegas in a Monday at 1 pm and they only have 1 person working the counter. Their process is slow, she averaged 10-15 minutes with each customer. If you like standing and waiting in lines, this would be the car rental agency to choose!",0
"I have been to Pink Polish several times now and have never had a problem.  I love the atmosphere; this is not your run-of-the-mill nail salon.  I love the the nail bar, very classy!  The ladies working seem like they are having a good time and are usually laughing (not at me or other customers) and the nice part is that if they are talking to each other, they usually try to bring you/me/the customer into the conversation.  Express pedi and polish change (my cuticles cut too easy, no mani's for me) get's me out of there under $30 (before tip).  Nice! Good quality.  Gel nails.  Clean space.  Spa like art work. I'm not a regular nail salon kind of girl, but when I do want to treat myself, I go to Pink Polish.",1
"Peas and Carrots.  Bevis and Butthead. Somethings go together well.  Korean and Hawaiian don't in this case.  Located in a strip mall with a lot of parking, this place has about 16 quad tables.  There are 8 of them side by side in the middle of the room so you can put several parties of 8 easily, so it's group friendly.  The menu is mainly Korean, but for some reason, they choose to put the word Island in the name of the restaurant giving me the impression they were Hawaiian.  We had the BBQ combo and the Pork Katsu.  I was looking for the Hawaiian aspect, but ended up with a Korean aberation of Hawaiian food.  The katsu sauce was more like a ketchup sauce or a shrimp cocktail sauce.  The pork katsu was over cooked and dry.  I suspect the cutlet was under a heat lamp i.e. precooked like a mickey dees.   The Kalbi and BBQ chicken were good.  The meat jun is coated with egg and like the cutlet, I seemed like it was a heat lamp item too.  It didn't have that freshly made taste.  I was disappointed after reading the good reviews.  If I come back, it would be for the Korean food because the photos on the wall look really good.  Maybe they should change the name of the restaurant to Seoul Style to give the customers a better description of what you're going to get.",0
"Turning 30 did NOT mean I wanted a hybrid, another 4-door sedan or something my mom would drive.  don't get me wrong, i love my mom. I just am not ready to turn into her.\n\nSo, it was time to get the convertible I have been talking about buying for YEARS.  After an online search through countless dealer sites, I came across my Saab convertible on the website for Lund Cadillac Hummer & Saab.  The high-def photos on their web site had me thinking I was looking at photos from a car show.  I called that same day to inquire about the one I wanted.\n\nThe internet sales manager, Frank Barela is great! He brought the car to me the next day (on my lunch hour!) for a test drive and made sure that all my questions we answered and needs met.  There was no hassle in the buying process and Frank made certain I was comfortable with my decision. \n\nOf course, the car had major selling points but the attentiveness and service level made my decision easy.  I am confident that my decision to buy from Lund (...and Frank) was the right one.  Every time I get a compliment on my car, I mention Lund and my experience. Thank you, Frank Barela! I love my Saab!",1
"Expensive bar food and mediocre service. \n\nWhen Tailgaters opened we were excited because it is close to our home. First experience was not good with poor service.\n\nThought we'd give them a second chance month later, so four of us went for happy hour for appetizers (didn't over consume or even eat dinner) and were amazed that our bill was nearly $100!!!\n\nMANY better choices in the area than this place! Drive a few minutes longer to go somewhere else and you'll be happier.",0
"After living in Vegas for about a year, this is easily the most disappointing high end meal I've had.  I'd give the food a 4/5 but the service was probably a 1/5.\n\nService\nThe first disappointment was waiting.  We had a reservation and even so I can understand waiting by the bar for a few minutes.  However, we wanted far more than a few minutes.  Our \""""leader\"""" went up to the front to inquire and they said on someone will be by shortly to seat you.  That didn't happen so we had to check back again and someone gave us the apology of \""""oh, I'm sorry I thought they came and got you.\""""\n\nMaybe a miscommunication, but certainly something that could be excused.  However, things didn't get better from there.  It seems like about 10 minutes from when we seated until we even got drink menus, then another 10-15 before the drinks arrive.  Easily 15 minutes before bread arrived at the table.  It just felt like everything was so slow.  After the first round of drinks came our waitress or waitresses seemingly disappeared.  I mean when you have a table of 10 people ordering rounds of $15 cocktails or better you'd figure service would be fast.  I think they easily missed out on  at least 1 extra round due to the slow service.\n\nIf you look at the prices at Mastro's and compare it to other places across town, you would expect to have a waiter or waitress that knows the menu back and forth and can describe all of the stars.  We got none of that.  I would say our service was at the level of an average chain restaurant.  You aren't adding any value when you ask about menu items and the waitress just lists 3 things that are \""""good\"""".  We asked how the steaks come and the reply was something like \""""what do you mean\""""?  I mean are they seasoned, sauced, dry aged?  There is no explanation on the menu or listing of sauces or accompaniments for the steaks....\""""oh yeah, they are seasoned and broiled\""""....thanks.\n\nThis was followed up with no description or explanation of any sides.  During the meal we couldn't even locate the waitresses and people were still anxious to get more drinks.\n\nI will say that the food was good.  The steak was unique in the regard it was so warm when it came out.  Usually food has somewhat cooled but their steak still had a sizzle and was warm for the first few bites, pretty good.  The asparagus was nothing special.  The lobster mashed potatoes were good but at $40 can be steep for a side dish.  Crab gnocchi was good, but I'm not crazy about gnocchi so I'm not an expert.  The problem in Vegas is that you can find a place equal to Mastro's food wise with probably lower prices so suffering through bad service can be a deal breaker.\n\nNeedless to say, nobody ordered dessert or drinks after dinner.  With so many other options in town for steak I probably wouldn't come back for that.  I will say I tried the ahi tuna sashimi which seemed great for under $40.  I didn't try it but the swordfish looked the same.  I would come back if I was in the mood for seafood but would be nervous about the service, maybe with a smaller party and a better table things would be better.",0
"small, stairs, sucks",0
"ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE EVER!! \n\nLet me just begin by saying that I drove with a family of 4 from southern California to enjoy a birthday dinner at this place. Because my husband & I are \""""foodies\"""" of sorts and MUST know the quality of food & service at every restaurant we try. We had pretty high expectations of Elixir being that we saw an average of 4 stars out of 5 BEFORE trying this place. To try making this long story short... The employees were RUDE to say the least. Our server rolled her eyes and sighing at our large party for the time it took to order (as it would normally for a party of our size), cursed when dropping dishes, got our order wrong AND blamed it on US!! I just couldn't take it any longer. I complained to the manager but her solution was to pay for a round of drinks. Wasn't worth it!! We should've walked out the moment we walked in and had a nasty hostess/server speak to us with her mouth full of fries. Disgusting!! If service doesn't matter to you then you MIGHT be ok... If they get your order right.",0
Been going here for more than 20 years and have found it to be consistently reliable. Whether at the sushi bar or at a table we've never left disappointed. I miss the candy sushi though.,1
"As is the theme with all the reviews I've read, the customer service is pretty bad and they force feed the insurance down your throat. I spoke with my State Farm agent prior to making a reservation and he made it crystal clear that since I have full coverage, I am covered when renting a car. When I mentioned this to the agent, she gave me some attitude and stated \""""Sir, I would like to inform  you that you are in Nevada, an at fault state and your insurance does not cover you in the event of an accident.\"""" \n\nThe line was about an hour deep and it was a bit disconcerting to go through that after waiting an hour. The reservation I made through carentals.com is simply an estimate, according to senorita Payless. So, instead of paying $8/day with minimum taxes, as stated in the agreement, we paid 3 times that amount and that's after declining insurance a dozen different ways. \n\nIdk if it's Payless or the industry, but someone needs to step up in Washington (once they get their shit in order) and figure out how to protect consumers from this insanity and price gouging.",0
"I finally got to Mi Amigo Ricardo's, last night. I had been looking forward to going after a friend recommended it and after noticing the full parking lot on many occasions.  But as it sometimes goes with anticipation and high expectations, I was disappointed.\n\nChips and salsa to start...I've honestly had better salsa from Target. My four year old daughter ate it, and she can't eat anything with even a hint of spice. My friend ordered the guacamole and it was ok, needed a little salt and a squeeze of lime.\n\nI ordered the Fiesta Plate which starts with a cheese crisp.  There was so much cheese that there was no 'crisp', but the kids sure liked it.  The highlight of the Fiesta Plate was the enchilada, which was actually quite good.  The beef Flauta wasn't bad either, just on the tough side.  The taco is where this rating went from an edible 3 to a 2.  The shell was a commercial hard taco from Old El Paso or some other such brand! Seriously, that's the best they could do?!  Every taco my Irish mother has ever made was better than this one.  They could have at least added some Old el Paso taco seasoning to the bland ground beef (yep you heard me right).  Head o Xavier's Casa Reynoso in Mesa if you want a good taco.  Order the Machaca Taco and tell them Tara sent you.\n\nThank goodness for the good company!\n\nSorry Ricardo's you're a 'no-go'.",0
"Saw it for the second time last week. If you are \""""ehh it's ok\"""" on Beatles music you will still like the show. If you love the Beatles, you will pee your pants in excitement. \n\nThe theater is fairly small and even the back row of the cheap seats has a good view of the action. In fact, I think the cheap seats are better than up front, because they allow you to see more of the action, for half the price. \n\nStill, I'd pay full price to see this over and over again.",1
"Easily one of the most beautiful churches and most beautiful buildings I've ever seen. The amount of detail in the art and architecture is absolutely amazing and I could have easily spent hours inside just admiring everything. There's a fee to enter during the day, but I suggest trying to do the night light show if possible. The light show is about 1 hr long and explains the history of the church and Montreal in general (an added bonus is that you can get the audio in English!). You get ~15 minutes after the show to admire the inside of the church (and take pictures) and pray if you so wish. This is an absolute gem and I would re-visit Montreal again just to see this beautiful building.",1
"Tasty and very affordable. For the money and speed of service,  you cannot go wrong with this place. Super good and fresh tasting food with a very speedy service for takeout or delivery. \n\nSpring rolls are delicious and light... very nice size for an order. All other chinese places do not compare in regards to size of portions and price. Love me some wai wai!",1
"This has changed over time and it looks like it has been bought up by Disney recently. \n\nMade to be fun for tourists, this tour involves a ride through the fermenting process and treating tour. After the random theme park ride you are then walked into what looks like a school room and given a presentation (although in the past it was mostly spoken now it seems to be predominantly slides) before you pick a whisky flavour and get to tasting. \n\nYou are then shown into the whisky collection room where you hear about the bottles around you until it is time to go to the shop. \n\nVarious prices available based of of the amount of time you want to spend here, but I recommend the cheapest option as it's quite dear and you can later go test your newfound whiskey tastebuds in the pub. \n\nI would recommend going to an actual distillery, but for tourists it would likely be a nice time.",0
"I went here because I am going to an event and needed a special bra. I think it is wonderful to have a specialty store in the Las Vegas area and apparently this is really the only one. However, the lady at the store was not friendly, actually made me feel uncomfortable. I ended buying something too large but needed something for this dress.",0

"This is really the only full-service sporting goods store in Central Phoenix and from workout attire, to basketball hoops, to skis, even to kayaks, it carries everything you could possibly need. Also, I haven't had any issues with service as described by other reviewers.\n\nMy only fear is whether or not this store will stay in business because it never seems to be very busy. And while that's great for parking, because the parking lot was always kind of a nightmare when it was an Albertson's, it does concern me that if they close I will have to start driving much further again for my athletic needs.",1
"Went to Majerle's for Trivia on Tuesday.. Its c ool because all the questions come up on the screens, but was too loud from the background music and random customers to focus on the questions. Food is good, and the 2 for 1 beer special is pretty awesome.  rated the place for being good, but not my first choice.",1
What an act!\nFood is poor quality and the layout is crowded but yet creative. I've been in the fast food industry for awhile in the past and I do love the menu layout and the unlimited buffet style add ons... BUT the food just sucks! The owner is a dick and thinks he is GOD'S gift.,0
"Talk about disappointment.  Awesome idea...poor execution.  I was so excited for this place to open up, and when I finally went I realized that I was simply waiting for a turd.\n\nI don't really know where to start.  The bartenders and staff suck.  The layout is pretty piss poor.  The selection of games is not so hot.  The music is too loud.  And the machines are way to clustered.\n\nWhen you walk in there's the bar in the middle...ok, that's not bad placement.  To the right of the bar are a handful of booths with video game consoles w their own TV's...cool idea but a lot of wasted space.  Then to the left of the bar are 40-ish arcade machines just jumbled this way and that...no real organization, just scattered about.  And then a dance floor in the back.  Ok, make up your mind...is this a video game bar or a dance club?  Just horrible space management all around.\n\nI only saw 3 arcade games that I would have even liked to have played...The Simpson's(an awesome classic), Ms Pac Man(another classic, but I can play it at home or on my phone whenever I want), and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.  Simpson's and UMK3 were both taken and had a swarm of wanna-be Jersey Shore looking applicants surrounding.  Plus it was a bitch to simply walk around and see the choices because there are too many people and the machines are to close together.  I don't know how many people I accidentally smashed into with my shoulders and vice versa, but it didn't really convey fun to me.\n\nAnd as far as the booths with the game consoles to play, I'm not going to go thru the expense or trouble to reserve or buy a bottle in order to play them.  Plus, why would I go there to play theirs when I have the same games, cheaper/better beer, a more comfy couch, and a bigger TV in my own living room.\n\nHad I never been to Ground Kontrol in Portland I may have liked this place more.  But for anyone who's been, then know what I mean...Ground Kontrol did this idea correctly!  Tons of arcade games in an organized fashion, great bartenders, cheap drinks, and a great vibe.  \n\nInsert Coins fails in all of these areas.",0
Amazing club! Beautiful staff and great service! I will definitely be back... I went three nights in a row after my first trip. The LED display is the best I have ever seen in my life!!,1
"This is a beautiful restaurant with impeccable service. \n\nI ordered the calamari based on the reviews.  It was good, but nothing special.  I agree with some other reviewers that it was under seasoned.\n\nThe lobster ravioli was very tasty.  The sauce was delicious.\n\nThe bananas foster did not disappoint.  It was the definite highlight of the meal.  \n\nI would not go out of my way to go to this restaurant while in Vegas, but I had a wonderful dining experience here.",1
"I went to Wild Vines with my girlfriends for drinks and dinner in celebration a girl's night. When we walked in there was probably 10 customers and one bartender. We had been greeted by the bartender immediately and water and menus followed 20 Minutes later. We ordered a round of drinks, the cheese platter and hummus appetizer. All items were good, but from that point on the night went south . No one came back for a second round of drinks or anything else until a new server started about 30 minutes later.  We finally placed our dinner orders,  shrimp skewers , Ahi salads, flat bread , shrimp pasta and chicken kabobs. The Ahi salad was $18.00 and foul in every way; the smell , the wilted lettuce, canned Chinese rice noodle sticks and Kraft bottled dressing; the most disgusting salad I have ever tasted.  The shrimp kabobs never came, but some creamy shrimp with a wilted salad came. The flat bread pizza was just thrown on a plate (piled on) it looked previously prepared and the chicken skewers never made it, my friend was so over the crappy service , she was about to go next door to sonic. The pasta; everything was edible but the shrimp.  When we sent everything back, the waiter made an excuse that everyone working today was new (including himself) and that they've had nothing but problems with the new chef. The bartender came by and took our plates to show the owner the food that came out, since she has had issues with the new chef as well and wanted him to see for himself. We ordered a grilled cheese and wedge salad to replace the Ahi salad and all I can say it was untouched as well.  After we asked to talk to the manager the waiter came back apologized and dropped a round of drinks from our bill to compensate. We weren't expecting more, but felt the owner should know how bad everything is, because it is his restaurant and you want repeat business. It seemed like the owner was hiding, avoiding to talk to us because he took forever to come to our table. The bartender came by and told us she was paying for our dinner on her dime because she felt so bad and we insisted that she bill us something so we can tip her since the situation with the chef was out of her control. She took each of our cards to put $8.00 in so we can each tip at least $10.00 . The Owner finally came to our table and apologized and said he suggested to pay for the bill (means the bartender lied to us) and appreciated our patience in a very relaxed attitude and gave us is own story of coming in because he was called in that he was needed and had to leave home sick to be there. #1 : why would any of you show your dirty laundry and throw your own staff under the bus. #2 why wouldn't you be so carefree to not compassionately care about your food, your staff, your service. I've said enough and review is may seem already winded , but I'm curious to see just how long it will take for this business to shut down. I felt like I was being filmed on Kitchen Nightmares. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day with this one. I don't even want to see their kitchen because I would probably throw up. Bummed that I have to give them one star.",0
"I work around the corner from this place, and having driven past on my way to work for a few months, I finally got the chance to give Copper Star a try, and I've been back 3 times in one week.  The design and overall feel of the interior is wonderful.  Especially now that the weather is getting cooler, I loved sitting inside next to the large open door, enjoying a lovely day.  I was there for a few hours working on my laptop, and I enjoyed that the people around me were a break from the normal \""""coffee shop crowd.\""""\nSpeaking of the coffee shop crowd, the employees here are nicer than any barista, anywhere.  Seriously.  They greet everyone with a smile, and take your beverage order without judgement (how refreshing!) while willing to give recommendations if you need a little guidance.\n\nBut the thing that really pushed it over the top for me is the baked goods.  OH.  MY. GOSH.  This morning I stopped in to get a muffin on my way to work and half an hour later, when I finally got a chance to eat it (still warm!!), I literally walked around telling half my coworkers about this muffin.  It was that good.\n\nThank you copper star, for becoming my new regular coffee shop.",1
"I love this place. The food is great and the beer is awesome.\n\nBUT, avoid this place during the summer. Or be prepared to sweat... alot.\n\nThere are no air conditioners and they use swamp fans instead. It can get pretty hot inside.",1
"Not sure what the big deal is about this place.  Yea, their ads on facebook look good but it's too bad the food taste doesn't match.  I got the meltdown and it was just okay.  Not very flavorful and I've had better burgers similar at bars.  Maybe I'd try it again for the breakfast but nobody in my group of 6 was very impressed.",0
"I wound up here the other night after walking down the street because of a 45 minute wait at Point Brugge Cafe.  While my friends and I were leery of the prices on the menu, the owner cajoled us into coming inside and were seated right away.  I'm glad he did!  The menu is rather expansive, but mainly focuses on Italian fare with an occasional jab at the more popular Pointe Brugge up the street: mussels and fries.\n\nIt happened to be lasagna night.  Because I am used to the home cooked variety, I had a hard time shelling out $18 for lasagna.  I selected the wild mushroom and spinach option and it also came with the soup of the day, which happened to be gumbo.  Both were very good.  The gumbo had a very earthy taste along with good amounts of sausage, jumbo lump crab, and risotto mixed in.  Rather than being the layered the lasagna was one giant noodle, the size of the entire plate, stuffed with a generous amount of mushrooms and spinach folded over itself with marinara and cheese.  Didn't get a chance to try dessert.\n\nBoth items I had were rather tasty, and I would easily come back here for a great meal.",1
"I had best, most tender ribs from this place! My family has been dying to go here but it's a little out of the way for locals, so we finally made our way here. The line took about 20 minutes and it was a little cramped inside, but there seemed to be enough seating. I got baby back ribs, mac & cheese, criss cross fries, and peach cobbler. The ribs are. so. good. Seriously. As well as everything else. Best BBQ I've had in a long time.",1
"Decided to go here on a whim because they have a clever name.  Turns out that's really all they have going for them, besides the cold beer.  The food was forgettable, the atmosphere was bleh the service was slow and the decor was like a failed attempt at Applebee's.  Needless to say, I won't be going back any time soon.",0
"A very odd experience.  \n\nWe entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess.  We told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what I thought was the bar area. Well, yes but she took us out the back door of the restaurant, to the back door of the bar.  Once there I started to get nervous.  A line of 4 or 5 people waiting to get in met by two security people checking Identification.  \n\nOnce you show the security people your ID, they then put a wrist band on you.  I am pushing 50, but perhaps without the wrist band, someone may mistake me for under 21.  \n\nFinally inside, it was a throw back to some 80's nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more, at attention security staff.  \n\nThey feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted Mexican food, which was actually fresh and tasty.  Our server was nice and attentive.  \n\nThe entire time we were there, I was worried to why they needed a security team roaming about.",0
"My first stop on my way in town for several years now.  This is the best chicken/fast food ever. I wish they had on in California.  So simple, yet so delicious.  What baffles me is how they can make such a moist juicy tender.  And it seams to be lean all white meat.  I love the slaw, the texas toast, fries and the sauce.  Another simple pleasure is the ice. I love th little tiny pellet ice.  Great to cruch without killing your teath.  :-)",1
"Happened by R&R the other day while going to the 7th Ave. shops.  It was inspiring and had things that caused me to covet.  However, the prices were sky high.  Take, for instance, the burlap pillows; I love the look, but the prices were over $50.  I went to another little vintage shop by the light rail and bought a huge one from France WITH feather pillows inside for only $27.  The lady working at R&R was just okay, only because I'm outgoing and she sort of had to talk to me. ;-)  Anyway, it's okay, but the antique mall at the corner of 7th Ave and Indian School Rd is MUCH better. (It's called Zinnia's I think.)",0

"In one word: overrated. In many words...\n\nIt's a tourist trap. It's a plastic version of the Old West. It is one of the few places in the Valley in which you can go bar-hopping... but like anywhere else in this swollen suburb you still have to drive to get there. And on that note, don't bet on light rail service reaching this area anytime soon. The mayor argued a light rail line running through Old Town would ruin the look of the area. Forget the fact that two streets-- one to the east and one to the west-- branch off from Scottsdale Road, run alongside Old Town, then merge back to the main drag, they say it will spoil the look. I guess asphalt roads, traffic lights and a parking garage in the middle of the city were staples in late-19th Century Western towns though. But, I digress. It has amenities and street life Downtown Phoenix can't seem to attract, but most cater to tourists. Like pretty much everywhere else in the Valley, you'll be hard-pressed to find unique street life and quirky, bohemian elements of it. Scottsdale Fashion Square is nearby, as it wouldn't flourish anywhere else in the Valley without out-of-town money flowing in, thanks to an abundance of low-paying jobs in the Phoenix area. \n\nA favorite haunt of 20K-millionaires and tourists, Old Town is a hilariously false representation of metro Phoenix. About as authentic to the Old West as Howdy Doody, if you're out for a pioneer-days pastiche you'll find it here.",0
"Clothes were okay. I hate clothing stores like forever 21 who have poor quality clothes thrown everywhere. Pitaya was at least organized. If it weren't for the employees i may go back. They were very unhelpful, rude, and there look didn't help the store. Too bad because i went two stores down to Diva's. Somewhat similar cloth (id prefer diva's) and the sales girls were great. Probably should have noticed the amount of people in Pitaya (0) vs the other stored in the area.",0
"This place is awesome for it being a chain.  I absolutely love the pizza, and think that it is the best in my area of town! The food is always really hot, and we always have it delivered! The delivery driver is always kind, and the person who takes our order is always very patient, and gets the order right every time.  One thing to remember is when you order fingers, make sure you say 'tossed' in the sauce, like mild or medium etc. The Godfather pizza is one of the best that is on the menu with lots of veggies! Onions and peppers etc. The plain cheese is also great.  KUDO's for getting it right and finally having a great pizza place with great service and great food!  The chicken Parmesan is fab as well!",1

Since i had to go back to work - no drinkie - had some root beer called rat bastard ( $5 ) - ok \n\norder kettle chips ( $6 ) \n\nGold Standard Burger ( $17 - add $2 more for onion rings ) \n\nCool looking place, in the mall area of the Cosmo - place was hopping today.\n\nGuy next to me seated 3-4 minutes after me - he gets his malt and sliders before i get my chips and/or burger....in fact, i never get my chips - the bartender didn't  hear me .....okaaay.\n\nThe burger - asked for it medium - it was juicy but no hint of pink at all ...none ... since the burger was juicy i can live with it.  My guess a quarter pounder, but not sure - overall, i liked it - the goat cheddar complimented the meat, lil micro greens were a nice touch and  bacon was all good  but $17 .... not sure about the pricing.  \n\nOnion rings were also decent but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nWill i try again ?  yeaaah - i want to try some of the sausages they apparently make in house.\n\nA pet peeve - they make mention of everything made in house yet what do they bring me when i get the plate of food - bottled catsup and mustard ( i believe heinz and french's ) - geez guys, can't you make it yourself ?  or at least put the stuff in a fancy container ?   At least they didn't pull a kgb and when i ask for mayo they throw me a few \""""to go\"""" tear open mayo containers .\n\npics will be posted later today",0
Food is OK.  Very eclectic mix of food.,0
"We went to recipes for breakfast today(8/15/10 Sunday). Food was below average, service was a little slow. To top it off, toward the end of out meal, i got up to take out son to the restroom. While up they cleared our table, even though myself and my son were not finished eating. I still had a diaper bag, cell phone and keys on the table. It was obvious we were coming back. This angered me greatly as i told my son he had to eat all of his food before we left. I complained about it however they didn't seem to care much. There were other empty tables so I do not see what the rush was to get us out the door.\n\nNote** review date says 10/15.. it was actually 8/15 just noticed that I never fully submitted.",0
"This place is horrible, I was assisted by one employee and she was more interested in signing me up for a credit card then actually helping me. Every time I asked to see a ring she would make a comment about how I needed to get something more expensive and not so cheap. She didn't listen to anything I asked for. On top of all that she kept whispering about giving my different amounts of discounts while looking over her shoulder. Very weird!",0
"If you want an authentic Mexican atmosphere, this is the place.  They have a trio playing popular and traditional songs at your request (weekends/weeknights).  The seafood selection is just right.  I've had the shrimp enchiladas and the shrimp in mushroom sauce with the \""""toritos\"""" as an appetizer.  They are jalapeno peppers stuffed with cream cheese and wrapped up in bacon, drenched in soy sauce.  Heart attack city but so worth it.   The only downfall for me is that there are way too many tables for the space and the noise level is at times a little overwhelming but after a few Micheladas (beer with clamato) the noise becomes happy whispers.",1
I don't know how people think this place is even slightly ok....we went here based on all the yelpers good ratings and was so disappointed.  I didn't care so much that the restaurant is ugly.  I'll take an ugly restaurant as long as the food is tasty and authentic.  But the thai curry we ordered was watered down and not very flavorful.  My daughter's wonton soup was awful.  I'm sorry the people were nice but the food was bad.,0
"I drove up from Chandler to this place to buy broken plates for mosaics and it really wasn't worth field trip.   It felt like Black Friday with the crazy people except the crazy people are going nuts over other people's garbage.  There really wasn't anything there that was worth buying everything was broken, defective, stained.  They want   99 cents a pound for the clothes and 59 cents for the other items.  If you buy the non clothes they end up being more expensive than if you just bought them at a goodwill on 50% off Saturday so I don't think it's worth it.  I picked up a plate that was labeled 99 cents, on the 50 percent off sale days it would be $0.50 here however the plate was $1.30 because of its weight which really doesn't make any sense.  Wasn't sure what to rate it because I talked to one of the guys that works there and he says it's always crazy that they feel they need to get out of the away cuz people will just push them so I don't know that's not for me it's probably not for a lot of people but for some  specific type of people they might have fun here.\n\nP.S. If you are going to venture out bring some workman's gloves because there are a LOT of broken glass items and other jagged objects in the bins that will cut you if you are not careful.",0
"We stopped in here because the Studio Buffet had a huge line. I had a coupon as well. But as I headed toward the restaurant I realized the coupon was only good for dinner. But we decided to try it anyway. I've been to the one on Sahara and it was good.\n\nThe waiter took our order and came right back with our drinks. It took longer for our meals. My husband ordered 3 egg breakfast with sausage and scrambled eggs. They brought him 1 1/2 eggs and the breakfast fries were cremated. He couldn't eat them. I ordered the upside down chicken pot pie. I'm not sure who invented this but they should lose the recipe. It was beautifully presented but it was awful. It was served in a thick hard cracker. The filling had no salt and was so bland. I ate the chicken out of it.\n\nI saw the french toast and the eggs benedict. They looked really good. I don't know if we miss ordered or all the food is bad.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful and easy to get to in the hotel. I will give it one more try, as I always give a place two tries. B  ut I don't think I will be recommending this restaurant.",0
"Had the medium miso vegetable ramen, pretty tasty.  The gyoza was really good, the spicy karage was a bit salty for my taste, but all in all had a good experience here and will be back!",1
Horrible customer service had a receipt and wanted to exchange something like I was told I could they told me they needed the complete original packaging which was a piece of cardboard way overpriced also,0
"BE CAREFUL if you are going to use any of their \""""deals\""""!  I was using 2 Daily Deal vouchers, I bought one for me and one for my Mom to use.  The deal states one per person, not per table, but they would only let us use one. The tacos were delicious, but the experience soured me.",0
"Nous y sommes all\u00e9s un mercredi soir. Cot\u00e9 ambiance, beau d\u00e9cor, mais un peu synth\u00e9tique / froid.\n\nLe gros probl\u00e8me est la nourriture. Le chef semble essayer de cuisiner pour des covers de magazines. La pr\u00e9sentation est bien, mais nos mets \u00e9taient mal ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.\nSteak calcin\u00e9 sur le dessus, accompagnement pass\u00e9 au micro ondes.\n\nIls offrent un menu gratuit pour les femmes le mercredi. Ils devraient laisser tomber ce menu, car il est honteux: pates surgel\u00e9s avec une sauce tomate d\u00e9cevante. C'est gratuit, heureusement, mais pas une tr\u00e8s bonne publicit\u00e9.\n\nLe service \u00e9tait bien, mais tr\u00e8s lent.\n\nBref, de la bouffe qui n'impressionne que par son arrogance et son prix trop \u00e9lev\u00e9.",0
"First time here. We were seated immediately, drinks were served & order taken. And waited for 45 minutes for our meals. Don't get me wrong -- the service was great; the server, though, forgot to expedite our order. He owned up to the error, discounted our bill by 50% & pushed our order through.\n\nI ordered the  Sunshine Combo (2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon or 1 sausage) & hubby ordered the Waffle Combo (same as mine only with waffle). They impressed me with their gluten-free options (totally appreciated that!), and the food was so tasty!!! When I commented on how good my pancakes were, the server offered to get hubby a regular pancake sample, which he really enjoyed. \n\nThe five-star rating I gave is a big indication of the server's accountability. He got a good tip, too, for handling it with humor. Pretty sure we'll be back!",1
"I went here last night on my nth visit back to this lovely place. And I realized I hadn't reviewed it here on yelp. So here I am. The first line should explain my stars. This is a perfect hangout place with your friends, a very good date place or a place you could just go for some low key relaxation. And when you are there you have to try the bruchetta. My personal favorites are the smoked salmon and the artichoke but they have a decent variety so mix and match. Last but not the least, it's a wine place so definitely have your glass. This is by far my favorite wine bar in Phoenix. Do visit.",1
"I used to like Filmbar. It had a good atmosphere and a great DJ on Saturday nights. They recently removed their comfortable seating and replaced it with high tables and hard chairs. I've had several bad experiences with the staff at Filmbar. The first time was when I wanted to see a movie that was sold out. I was unaware it was sold out,, but the girl at the counter was very rude to me and told me I should have known it was going to sell out and it wasn't her fault I didn't plan ahead - yet their website said nothing about it being sold out, and that's something I did check before driving down there. But since there was no parking, and I had to park far away and walk a long distance, I guess that should have been a clue. But aside from that, 2 other times I have gone there to see a movie and waiting for service at the counter to buy a drink and was ignored. One of those times, it seemed as if patrons line up to be served. So I stood in line and waited, and when it got to be my turn, the bartender went over and talked to his friends and basically ignored me. This place has terrible service. And regarding the person who posted that they were kicked out of the bar for not having a current AZ ID, I have seen children at this bar. (I am assuming the children were there with their parents) But my point is, if children are allowed to be at this bar, I don't see why someone who is over 21 with an old style AZ license should be turned away.",0
"This place rocks!! Endless amounts of junk by the pound at give away prices.\nEasy to shop digging tables and bins. I would recommend going on a Wednesday tho, this is when all clothing and linens (everything in green and yellow bins) is only $0.50 per pound!!! \n\nStaff all seem very knowledgable and willing to help when asked! \n\nIf your a thrifter or out to treasure hunt for that hidden gem... This is the place for you!",1
Even slower than Walgreens and at least walgreens will fill your prescription from off site without making you drive across town to another pharmacy to get a prescription filled.,0
"This is my second time here after not having a good first experience & giving a huge amount of time away from the moment to come back again to give it another try. First time was a hair in the food. Which I have to say they took off of the menu (Ceviche apt.) This time just didn't do anything to make me go back again. I would rather go to an On The Border. \nNice bar selection, but it doesn't make a difference if the bartender can't make a drink. We sent back our drinks 2 times & then I just gave up. Food wasn't anything special either. The quesadilla that should have chicken in it was mostly just filled with cheese. Hubby ordered the beef beef brisket. It was way to salty & cold. I had the fajitas which were tasty. The one great thing is the salsas they offer. Great flavor & heat! Unfortunately it's not enough for me to return.\nI think this place gets such a high rating for it being in South Park. \n\nNo Thanks!",0
Ok place. Flaky on special orders and overly aggressive with selling.,0
"I have had the displeasure of dealing with US Airways for the past week. On May 2nd I flew with them and ended up having to check some things that I was not planning on. \nAfter a layover in Phoenix I reached my destination of Las Vegas where I discovered that my laptop, a bottle of vodka, as well as a few pairs of my underwear- were all taken.\n\nOf course, these are all things that the airline will not cover, but the baggage claim woman had me file complaints anyway. She was incredibly helpful and sorry- I wish I had remembered her name. In the beginning we had thought it was TSA- as they had opened my bag and left a love note in it telling me so.  TSA actually viewed the security tapes so that they could clear them selves.\n\nUS Airways refuses. They keep trying to put the blame on everyone else, saying everything from their baggage handlers are outsourced, to it could have been someone just in the airport. Really?\n\nWith all that's been going on with airport security, DO NOT TELL ME THAT THESE PEOPLE AREN'T UNDER SOME SORT OF SURVEILLANCE. \n\nAlso, all their call centers are outsourced, so while thats not really the issue they cant really give you any other information unless it pops up on their computer screen. At one point one of them even told me that my items had been located- which was obviously not the case.\n\nNever fly with these people. Besides the fact that my stuff got stolen they charge for almost everything when you fly, and we never actually encountered a friendly worker on the plane.",0
"Hole in the wall - check.  Stern (at times) owner who rules his roost - check.\n\nI don't really trust a Vitnamese restaurant to be really really good unless it is a hole in the wall kind of place.   :)  And this place is good.  Now, my one beef with this restaurant is the limited menu.  But really, they do everything on the menu so well that you can't really complain.  And the prices are extremely reasonable.  Make sure you get the fresh rolls.  I usually get the vermicelli with a little bit of everything on top.  And unless you are ridiculously hungry, get the smaller bowl - it is still a lot of food.\n\nBYOB, so feel free to bring your own alcohol of choice.  I can't remember what the corkage fee is, probably because there is none, I believe.  And bring cash.",1
I called this morning and FIRST asked what your shop hourly rate is ? The polite response was $90 / hour. I was not thinking it would be the same as legal fee's or a doctor's office hourly rate ? Last I checked these professions required 6-8 years of college education and strict legal boards in order to acquire the license to practice. Not to mention insurance as well as staff payroll. So without wasting anyone's time I suggest the first question you ask any auto repair shop is what is your hourly rate ?,0
"We usually like PF Changs but something about the orange chicken - we got another order, explained to one of the partner's Peter that it was too tomato based vs orange glaze - still wasn't right the 2nd time but we just took it home and put it in the fridge.  they didn't charge us for it and were gratious - oh well, just an of night I suppose.",0
My 85 yr old mother has used this service previously with acceptable service. Waited 1/2 hr for shuttle to arrive then another 1/2 hr before leaving airport. Van had 6 passengers with excessive amounts of luggage--2 did not have reservations. It was total chaos. She arrived in Phoenix at 7:45 pm and did not arrive at her home until 12:30 pm. Totally unacceptable.,0
"So many different opinions, you just have to try for yourself. Me... If I'm in the area, it's Al's. Every time.\n\nThe Italian Beef is very, very good. No Chicagoans, It's not Portillo's. It's not supposed to be. It's Al's! So to all of us who hail from the windy city, let's all hold hands and make peace with the fact that Al's isn't Portillo's. That's why the sign above the door say's \""""Al's\"""". Now shut up about it!\n\nI ate at Portillo's three or four times a week when I was back home, and I'm looking forward to them being here too. But I'm just as happy to have Al's. This place is great!\n\nThe Polish is very good. Hot Dogs are great; The Combo was sooo sloppy good I was in heaven. The Italian Beef was awesome! Love the dipped option, sweet & hot with provolone. Sooooo damn good I'm getting hungry just thinking about it now!\n\nFries are just like Nanna's Hot Dogs on Irving Park, what I grew up with. Sooooo good! And to J.P. from Chandler.... All of the hot dog places I grew up with in Chicago always did and still do wrap your fries and dog together in paper. It's authentic, so enjoy the experience.\n\nFolks, it comes to this. Al's does it their own way, so quit comparing it to every other place. They don't need to be anyone else! This place is great, a Chicago Institution that has stood the test of time, and worth the price tag. Especially if you're a wayward Chicagoan longing for the flavor's and feel of the windy city. \n\nWalk into Al's, and you're home. Even if just for a little while. Mangiare!",1
"Well, I went back 2-3 times since the Grand Opening. All on Wednesdays because Simplified was playing! That's the ONLY reason I'd go there. I spoke with a manager the 2nd time I went there and he told me he personally would put Corona on the beer order! Still don't have it. I'd have to agree that the female bartenders are not very friendly, ever! No smiles, no \""""how are you\"""", etc... Nothing! And that is each time I've been back! Two weeks ago I ordered a burger. It was ok. Fries are not very good. Last week I ordered a triple grilled cheese. It literally was THE smallest sandwich I've ever had. Two small bites and the 1/2 was gone! Way too little food for their prices! Add that with a bar staff that isn't friendly and you have a recipe for failure! If it wasn't for Simplified playing, I would not go back!",0
"Great store for finding specialty items. They also have the cheapest prices I've seen for the energy bars I like. The only thing I wish they had more of is non-foods. Not a huge selection of soaps, shampoos, etc. Still have to go elsewhere for those. As with most specialty stores they are on the pricey side (other than the energy bars!), so I certainly can't do all my regular shopping there.",1
"Gimmicky and a bit Trashy.\nBland food, and even worse wine...\nThey only ask you if you want Red or White. That should be indication enough-\nSimple menu options, and a really sweet \""""Cappuccino\"""" to end the meal...\nI went once, and that was more than enough.\n\n\nThe old school Italian ambiance is what makes it worthy of that extra star...",0
"Went here based on recommendation from the hotel. There wasnt much in the area. It was a friday night they didn't have the nba all star game on just olympic ice skating and the sports illustrated swimsuit awards as well as 20/20. The waitress constantly forgot things that we asked for. She did not know the menu. and the spicy lemon pepper wings were way to spicy to even taste the lemon pepper. I sent them back and I over heard the gentleman in the booth behind me send his back for the same reason. I did enjoy the sandwich and fries that I ordered afterwards. If im in the area again, I dont know if id go back, maybe if there are no other options.",0
"This place is unclean, has poor service, and pricey vs other like-type restaurants. \n\nI ordered the half chicken and rice (#32). It came with 2 drumsticks. WTF?\n\nThis place is tanking and it's easy to see why after eating here - numerous other reviews say the same thing.  I'd look for t\nOther places to eat.",0
"Delicious food, good service, relatively low price. This cozy restaurant has an intimate feel and the accompanying limited seating. The food is consistently good and prepared to requested spiciness.",1
"They gave me  a cup to pour my own coffee out of those decanters where you pump the coffee using a lever on the top, like a cheesy hotel cafeteria.  Not very fresh, and a coffee was $2.50. \n\nThe \""""Bold Ethiopian Night\"""" coffee was not bold at all.  Watery.  It's too bad, I really wanted to like this place.",0
"Budget buffet.  Use coupon or discount to make it even cheaper.  (Lunch) Lots of cold dish choices such as salads.  Not as many hot dish choices.  No crab legs, lobster, and orange pork instead of orange chicken.  If you have a choice of a complimentary buffet, Don't pick Luxor over Aria... come on.",1
I cant believe they even call this a club its just a glorified gambling whole.  If you are looking to go to a club just go to marquee,0
"This is a wonderful find, the food warms the soul, it's affordable and the portions are gigantic. This place has it going, and we can't wait to go back, I just hope more people find it and it stays in business. Please go, you won't regret it!",1
"Just stopped by Ishi this past weekend.  And, it has changed a lot.  The quantity of food is less.  The food did not taste as good as it used to.  and...to top it off....for some reason, their \""""special beverage\"""" license was allowed to expire...or it was not reissued.  I was disappointed.  It had been a long time since I was there....and now...it may be even longer when I return.",0
"I am a big brisket fan, so I ordered the brisket platter. The portion was small but the flavor was even smaller or non-existant. The was absolutely no flavor other than the vinegar based sauce they used, which wasn't very good either. The brisket had no noticeable smoke ring and had smoke flavor. The brisket was dry and chewy except for the sauce. \nThe onion ring were bland, nothing special. The menu said cold beer and they couldn't even get that right. Over-all I was highly disappointed. I was hoping to find some place closer to home than Mac's speed shop for good brisket but I guess I'll keep looking.",0
"This is a good place for lunch.  Their sandwiches, salads and pizza are really good.  Some of my personal favorites is the Black and Bleu salad, the BBQ chicken pizza and the Newks Favorite salad.  \n\nThe only down side is that the prices isn't as friendly as I would like them to be.  Other than that.... A great lunch spot indeed.",1
"Needed a new transmission and they assured me it was doable and I was quoted half the prices of the dealership. I should have known better, but I was working part-time and unemployed.\n\n10 business days later I got my car back and had to pay $1000 over the quote. My car never ran right. \n\nCourteous staff, probably great for lube jobs and other smaller fixes.",0
"I was given a car with a key but without a key fob to control the alarm.  By the time I discovered it, I was hours away from the airport.  The entire time I had the car, the alarm went off every time I unlocked the car.  As you can imagine, it was a significant pain.  I told the check-in guy about the problem when he brought the car back, and asked him to make a note of it.  He didn't seem to care, and I haven't heard from Budget about it.",0
"I had oral surgery scheduled the next day with general anesthesia.  And, after reading and having to acknowledge in writing all the dire warnings of unwelcome side effects that could potentially occur, including death, I gave some real thought to what food I would like to eat the night before the dental procedure, for what could be a last meal.  And after great reflection,rather than selecting a gourmet experience, Filet & Lobster, or a high-end AYCE casino resort buffet feast, I opted--surprise!--for a Shredded Beef Taco and Bean & Cheese Burrito at Roberto's.  And they both were delicious!\n\nThe burrito was large and elongated in shape, with the smoothest, obviously slow-cooked Refritos imaginable, and oodles of melting Cheddar Cheese.  The taco had a crisp wavy shell, mounds of Cheddar Cheese, fresh lettuce, added diced tomatoes at no extra charge, and some requested Guacamole at a nominal cost.\n\nIt was only my second time at this Roberto's, and on this occasion I encountered no mixed up order or cleanliness problems.  A solid 4-star experience all the way!",1
This is such a nice library: clean and modern with lots of natural light and lots of areas where you can settle in and study. The have a LOT of computer workstations and can accommodate a lot of people.\n\nThey also have a nice outdoor patio area that is peaceful and inviting. I firmly believe that the right environment is important when you're trying to study or get work done. This place EXCELS on that level.,1
"$9 bottle of water.  Enough said.\n\nThis place is way overpriced, too crowded, and not worth the long wait to get in.",0
"Terrible food, slow service with attitude. Don't waste time or money on this place. Ordered two appetizers, both disgusting. The smell and taste of old grease was awful. Ordered a coke and beer. The coke was just soda water. Told the waitress and she said, \"""" I know, we are busy.\""""  How about serve us water and say the coke needs to be changed. I guess they are use to serving SLOP.",0
"I haven't been to Yummi Sushi for awhile. Last time I went was like at  least 7-8 years ago when my friend took over the place back then.\nMy husband wanted to have some good Japanese lunch but little more than just a ordinary sushi place.\nSo I thought of this place because it seemed like they have new owner and got great reviews.\nWe went there yeseterday for lunch.\nI was very satisfied with their menu and something that you cannot find at just neighbor sushi restaurant.\nI had live Octopus,Sashimi lunch special and some fresh sushi and sashimi they recommended.\nOh, and their fresh Tacoyaki is really really great!!!\nEverything was so fresh and great!\nIt might be little pricey if you get live fish but it is worth it!\nI love this place!",1
Carlos the bartender was real nice. Thought this place was empty but once you walk in you see the packed patio. Came in and it was happy hour.not a bad thing but nothing special really. Had a pretty good appetizer in the stuffed quesadilla.,1
"One of the best meals of my life.\n\nI should begin by saying I wasn't feeling well this day, not well at all. So while I was able to taste everything, I did not finish one single dish and it haunts me every day.\n\nThe environment is overwhelming and elegant, exactly what you'd expect from an upscale Vegas restaurant. Soft gold lighting, pillars, purple and black accent walls...this is a very cool looking restaurant. \n\nThe service is leaves nothing to be desired. Our waiter, Mr. Bond, was delightful and intelligent. He played with us, posed for pictures, was knowledgable about the food and made excellent suggestions. It felt like he'd been a part of our group for years. \n\nWe did the Chef's Signature menu, which was Wagyu beef tartar, scallops, and Wagyu sirloin, and dessert. \n\nThe Wagyu beef tartar was a very clever dish. Eggs, tarter, and chocolate are not 3 items I would typically think to pair together. However, they blended and clashed beautifully. The texture was playful, the flavors sang in harmony, and the portion was just enough to keep you wanting just one more bite. \n\nThe scallops were absolutely perfect. I can remember exactly how they taste to this day. Each bite was this unpredictable explosion of rich, slightly salty, flavors with this perfectly caramelized crust. Truly incredible.\n\nThe Wagyu sirloin still costs me about one good night of sleep a week. For whatever reason, I was just not hungry at all when we got to this dish. I hadn't had that much to eat before this, the portion sizes were spot on, but I was having some stomach issues (completely unrelated to Sage) that left me unable to finish my order of sirloin. I can still see that plate disappearing from before me as the water took it away...still feel judgmental eyes on me from my friends, who had all managed a happy plate. It was the best steak I've ever had in my life.\n\nThere were two desserts available, each deconstructed. One was a fruity/lemony dish, the other chocolate. Each was decadent and savory, rich and playful, and completely different from one another. I'm happy we ordered as a group and didn't have to choose between the two.",1
"Brought my Honda in to get the brakes fixed. The older guy in service was really nice until a few weeks later. I filled out an online survey and apparently did not given the results they wanted. He called me up and verbally abused me about my answers. I told him I was being honest and he said \""""didn't we give you excellent service?\"""" he was really mad. I told him I would never return if this is how I would be treated after being honest. I hung up on him. It was an opinion survey!",0
"This place rocks. As other reviewers have said, its not the newest, fanciest or most technologically endowed theater, but its clean, comfortable, and shows some independent and foreign films. \nSince moving to the Westside of town, we've enjoyed this theater on a couple different occasions. We've found it to be very clean, have friendly staff and never be too full. The prices are still consistent with other theaters, so you won't be able to save a ton of money, but you won't have to deal with  the smoke of a casino or the crowds of some of the newer theaters. \nThere are a lot of great places to eat around the theater, which makes it very convenient for a date night, and it is not too hard to find a close parking spot which is nice for a cold winter night or hot summer day.",1
I love this place! I have been wanting to go here for a while and finally when a business associate and I were planning on meeting I decided to meet here instead of Starbucks. The tea is fantastic and the Green Chili Chicken Panini along with the pasta salad is super tasty. I have been here about five times in the past month - I take all my meetings here now! \n\nThe atmosphere is trendy and comfortable. The two private rooms are very reasonable to reserve and very chic.,1
Great selection of local and national beer.\n\nGreat place to hang out with a large group.,1
"Definitely a bucket list kinda thang!!! \n\nBF and I wanted to do something different and something we've both never done before.... I saw this deal on Amazon Local and figured that's COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from all the hype that is Las Vegas. \n\nAlthough we started way early for my liking, it was a pretty dope experience! \nFrom watching them inflate a hot air ballon that came outta a family van, to being 1300 feet above ground, to watching them deflate the hot air.... It was something we'll both never forget! \n\n\nPlease take note: I'm scared of heights and didn't look down once. But, it was amazing. And didn't even feel shaky at all. Felt like we were on solid ground.",1
"Dear 4&TWNT,\n\nWe started off rocky a week ago with a porchetta sandwich that was a little light on the por and super heavy on the... uh... etta? More fat, less meat. There we go. Tamar loves you guys though, and she's like my Jewish mom. Mom said go back. I did. And I'm happy I did. \n\nThe chicken salad sandwich is pretty spectacular. It's served on toasty sourdough along side some greens with a zippy little dressing that's a lil sweet and a lil sour. Chicken isn't overly dressed in thick mayo-y mayhem. It's super light, packs quite a punch, and you should love knowing it's local. \n\nNot typically a dessert eater pie grabbed my eye, and when I asked the gent for a rec (Scott maybe?) he said blackberry was the way to go. And so I went there. He warmed that bad boy up post sandie and then I shoveled it in my mouth the second he dropped it off. Seriously at one point I remember saying to myself (internally) \""""take a break... you've been going at this thing, you're in public... breathe... enjoy.\"""" But it was too good. Flaky crust. Tart berry inside. Coarse sugar sprinkled atop. The only thing missing was cloyingly sweet aftertaste and corn syrup which they apparently don't use to bind fruit. (Big ups for that.)\n\nAnd now a plea: Furniture builders of Madison... craft a cool table to run the entire length of the wall and give these guys more seating. They're growing, and it'll be impossible soon (like tomorrow) for mass peeps to eat and enjoy. Donate a mean mesa and I bet they'll put your cards out and tell everyone they know about your rad add. (Hell I'll even write a review solely on the cool community table you build).",1
"Wow! Instead of making things better with their follow up they made things worse! As you can all see there is a comment from the management on my review asking me to contact them which I did right away. Got an email back saying that the manager at the Tempe location will contact me with an offer. Well, guess what? Two weeks later haven't heard a word from her! I'm definitely done with this place. \n\nMaybe instead of being reactive and trying to put out fires after they emerge they should pay more attention to making it right the first time.",0
"**Original review from 5/5/2011. Updating new profile.**\n\nAnother place I must visit when I'm out in Vegas. Of course, I've only been here 3 times and each time I get the same thing. Lump Crab Eggs Benedict. Heaven in my mouth! I don't come here for the coffee, which is drinkable, but not the best. I come here for this heavenly lump crab dish.... and the deli/bakery items. My mom had me try the potato cakes last time we were there and..... excuse me. Had to take a breather. Just thinking about those delicious, wonderful potato concoctions with the apple sauce.... Yummmmmmmmm.\n\nThe cafe service has been great for me each time. The last time I was there was on a Sunday morning and they were jam packed!!! The waitress was great and attentive, even though the place was packed. On busy days, I understand poaching eggs can be a little difficult because there's a lot more to pay attention to, so when I pointed out that my eggs had been overcooked, without hesitation, she comped me for one of my favorite things in the bakery. (I didn't want them remade.... they were still edible)\n\nThe bakery staff is why this place didn't receive a 5 star rating from me. Since I'm still new to the place, I didn't know that you had to stand in line at the deli to get service at the bakery. No one spoke up and when I tried to get the attention of one of the guys, I was blown off. When I finally received service, I placed my order and then asked for something from the deli. He treated my request as a big inconvenience. Needless to say, if it's a busy day, I'll just eat at the cafe and leave my bakery/deli order for another, less busy time.\n\nTheir food is great. Their bakery and deli items are delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone, but I would tell them to be patient and try to go when it's not so busy.",1
"I wish I read these ratings before using this company.\n\nFirst time I have ever used them for my business, and as of right now, no one can tell me where my package is, or why it did not make it to its destination on time.  They don't have answers, just want me to fill a form out.  Meanwhile, my business has lost money for this undelivered package.... the customer needs it today, not tomorrow.  \n\nWill never ever use them again.  Don't trust that anything you send with this company will make it.",0
"We've eaten here multiple times during two trips to Vegas - always good. From breakfast to \""""midnight\"""" snack (although it was more like 3am) Portions are plenty, staff is super friendly and the drinks are great. We'll be back next year for sure.",1
"I feel like I'm dead at the end of every work out.. It's great! I wish the location was a little closer to my house, but the drive is worth it and the hallway is a little cramped to walk through during high volume hours. Otherwise I'm definitely a fan.",1
Such a great and fun restaurant. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is upbeat. A DJ plays music in the middle of the place. The only bad thing is there is only one bathroom so you have to wait in a LONG line.,1
"Very nice place, great restaurant and bars!! I love how they infuse the air with a coconutty smell like suntan lotion!!! Better then cigarette smoke! The staff is nice and helpful!",1
"I stopped into this location at 11:30 am. The parking lot was clean and the entry doors appeared clean. I needed to scan my CVS card and this location was convenient to my next work stop. When I entered I looked for the scan machine, it was not by the front register. I looked about the store for signage that might have directed me to this little jewel of a machine. I didn't see any. From experience, I headed to the pharmacy dept, there is usally one in that section. I didn't see the machine. I went to use the restroom, HUGE mistake. The restroom was filthy! (mirrors, sinks, papers on the floor, fecal material on the toilet seats). There were no toilet seat liners available or disposal paper towels. Luckily I carry hand sanitizer at all times. I could not believe how neglected this facility was especially when I associate CVS with health care. This was horrible. I never did find the scan machine and will never go back to this location!",0
"As an avid target shopper, I consider myself a self-proclaimed expert on all things Target. This particular Target is not that great. It's more of a 'run in and grab the basics' kind of Target. \n\nThe departments feel like they're not fully fleshed out and missing the full stock of things. During the day, the staff is hard to find on the floor for some reason except for when its near closing time. Also, there are never enough cashiers for check out, so pack your patience.",0
"Question: \""""We're only here briefly, and while I'm here I want to allow myself joy.\""""\n\nA. Quote from the movie, \""""Her\""""\nB. What I think of everytime I have a burger from Badger Cafe\nC. Both of the above\n\n\nBest way to go is ordering from Rum Runner Lounge and enjoying it with a large ice cold beer.  In fact, I don't think I've actually ever eaten inside the restaurant.  From what I could usually see through the windows of the bar next door, the place actually looks quite small with limited seating.  I like how they even let their guests customize their own burgers to whatever they desire.  Can't go wrong with \""""the works,\"""" fried egg, avocado, and roasted sweet pepper.  \n\nOverall, Badger Cafe serves up one of the best burgers in town!!  I definitely recommend this place especially for out-of-towners... worth the short drive out of the strip.",1
"Terrible service. The food was decent, but not great. Ordered our food and then didn't see our waitress again for another forty five minutes. The other staff was not helpful when we asked for refills or Parmesan and we eventually had to ask for the management just to get some refills. Would not recommend.",0
"The first time I had Paciugo's was at a mall in the food court. It was a heavenly memorable experience.\n\nWhen I saw the one within biking distance on State Street, I squealed with happiness! \n(Recently relocated to Madison from Ohio).\n\nRotating flavors, something for everyone. Decadent. Incredible. Delicious.\n\nI die. Sorry, FroYo... over you :)",1
Are here for lunch. Ordered a medium burger that came well done. Burger was not only overcooked but boring with stale bread and fries were nothing special. My coworker had veggie burger and said it was not great either. Would not eat here for lunch again but I heard breakfast is good.,0
"There are many deals to be found at this store, especially if you're looking for apparel since there are always items on sale or on clearance and they have a pretty large selection of Oakley branded t-shirts, polos, hoodies, jackets, board shorts, shorts and backpacks. These are also the items you'll usually find on the clearance or sales racks. Haven't noticed as many deals on accessories and sunglasses. Customer service is good here since they have many associates for such a small store, however, there is only 1 fitting room so expect a wait if you're planning on trying something on.",1
"I'll give credit for being one of the cheapest food options inside the Rio. Tried the chicken pad Thai while my husband had the chicken lo mein. It was $14 a dish, but they serve huge portions. We wished we'd known that, so we could've split just one entree. Nonetheless, bigger portion doesn't mean better taste. Both dishes were simply okay, like I attempted making these dishes in my own home, not like I was at a legit eating establishment. The dishes tasted like some key ingredient was missing, but I couldn't identify what. Felt very gross after eating here, and again when reheating the leftovers the next day.",0
"I really hate even giving these clowns one star, as it's an insult to the star.  I called Appliance Specialists one month ago and had my dryer \""""repaired\"""" by Steve. He seemed pleasant enough and said that the dryer should run for several more years with no issues. Here I am, four weeks later, and after contacting the company, I was assured that they were proud to stand behind their work and would be at my home between 1pm-2pm today. Now that they're an hour later, I called and was hung up on. When I called back (thinking I might've been disconnected), I got their voice mail box.  So much for customer service or common congeniality.  These guys are the worst I've ever dealt with and how they stay in \""""business\"""" is a wonder.  Please beware!!!\n\nUPDATE!\nI left the above review yesterday, September 18th. Today I've had a service technician from Wright's Appliance Repair come to my home to repair the dryer ASS-Company had supposedly already fixed last month. This new technician found that the person who'd just worked on my dryer had cut a couple of electrical cords within the dryer which caused a domino effect of issues with the machine causing it to fail.  I stand by my statement of \""""Beware!\"""" and highly urge prospective clients to consider any alternative to Appliance Specialists.",0
"I have to say I was impressed at how the management at this location addressed the issues I voiced in my earlier review.  Just when I thought customer service was dead, especially at corporate chains, I was shown otherwise. The manager contacted me via Yelp message and offered me his personal cell phone number to discuss my visit (I didn't call, but appreciated the offer).  He also offered me a gift card to come and try the restaurant again.  I took him up on that, and went there yesterday (I tried to check-in on Yelp from their location, but apparently my signal was low in there, and I kept getting an error message).  I had the Chopped Salad again -- this time the arugula was delightfully fresh, as were the other ingredients!  I requested mine without the dried corn this time, and they offered to give me extra of something else.  The salad was great, and was served in a pretty timely fashion, though they were in the middle of lunch rush. Also the tables were cleared quickly once guests left, which was especially good because the place was packed, and otherwise I would have had nowhere to sit.  The server came back right away to wipe the table for me, as promised.   The fresh-squeezed OJ was very good, although the lid was sticky on top.  And since it was over 110 degrees here yesterday, any A/C felt good - so the temperature inside was not a problem.  In fact, it felt perfect.  Overall, a nice lunch experience!",1
"great sushi. The spicy octopus is the best. The prices are reasonable. Geo is the best waiter there. The rest are okay but he is really good, quik and very friendly.",1
"I decided to head to Las Vegas at the last minute for New Years weekend, and got a great deal for 4 nights at  The Orleans. I knew this was an off the strip hotel that catered to locals and tourists so my expectations were low. \n\nWhen I arrived I decided to valet my truck and have the bell man take up my bags. I got a very icy reception from both individuals, as they grunted a few words as I put my own bags on the cart. I just figured Id give them the benefit of the doubt since it was cold out side and they must be grumpy. \n\nI arrived to the front desk to check in and again was greeted with half smile and a front desk person who wasn't very friendly, rarely spoke to me and did not smile once. As I headed to my room, i thought well for the price i guess i cant expect to much. But things started to turn around. The gentleman who brought up my bags was very nice and friendly, a few minutes later, housekeeping was at my door welcoming me and letting me know they were there 24 hours if I needed anything. The housekeeping staff was always friend and nice and greeted me as I walked down the hallways. \n\nThe rooms were ok, stock hotel rooms that had the basics. .  They do have newer remolded rooms for a higher price, but it is Las Vegas and I don't spend a lot of time in the room, so it was fine. \n\nThe rest of my trip was much more positive. We ate at two of the hotel restaurants. The first was Canal Street. One of the hotels nicer restaurants. We had a wonderful steak diner and was reasonably priced. The steak was cooked to perfection and the  loaded baked potato that was delish. The service was superb and had the best waitperson who chatted up with us while we enjoyed our meal. We ordered the chocolate fondu for dessert but found it cold and and not very tasty. I had two martini's that were made to perfection.  Defiantly a place to check out. \n\nThe second place we at quite a bit was the Courtyard Cafe. For hotel cafe food, this place was pretty decent. The menu consisted of standard cafe food of burgers, sandwich's, salads and breakfast. We ate there mostly light night/early morning with a limited menu. The rest of the time they have a full menu.  The food was good and again great service by wait staff that were friendly and engaging.  On the 4 times we ate there we had nothing negative at all with the food or staff.\n\nThe gambling and bars were fine, standard slots, and drinks were the same as any other casino in town, and the bar staff were friendly and drinks were poured well. \n\nUpon my leaving, I had the bell desk take my bags down and valet to get my truck and I must say the service was much better than when I arrived.  Everyone was nice and friendly and helpful a much better crew than when I arrived\n\nAll in all The Orleans Hotel is decent place to stay if you don't want all the glitz and glamor of the hotels on the strip. Reasonable prices with pretty much a friendly atmosphere and decent rooms. I would defiantly stay there again. Its a good place if you don't want to spend a lot, don't mind something off the strip .\nAll in all a good stay.",1
"If you're leaving Vegas, know that this is the very last time you will have to shell out an ungodly amount of money for pure crap. \n\nWe just wanted a nice refreshing soda with ice and a straw to sooth our yucky tummies.

"THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE NAIL SALON!!!! I've never seen another place like this in Vegas. I asked them to customize my nail for my 21st bday, And they did such a great job I was do satisfied. It's unique, clean, PINK, luxurious, being in there made me feel like a queen. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED even if you just want a Mani and pedi  :) I'm a regular!",1
"Super yummy! The crust is thin enough to not make you feel like you ate too much. Everything looks fresh, and of quality. & it's very inexpensive. Definitely found our new pizza spot!!! Yay!",1
My experience at the Gilbert House restaurant was not a good one. The hostess who also claimed to be the owner was very friendly to the people she knew and virtually ignored everyone elso who was waiting. In fact I felt she was rude and rather insulting.\n\nMy food was average at best especially considering the length of time we waited. \n\nThe house is quaint and our waitress was very nice but under the circumstances that isn't enough to make up for an otherwise bad dining experience.,0
"the 2-star description of \""""Meh. I've experienced better\"""" couldn't be any more dead on for this place, *especially* in light how many best.pizza.ever reviews i've seen on here and from noted chefs and celebrities. for all of you who think that, i'm sorry but maybe you've never been to new york. hell, maybe you've never even been to new jersey, b/c this wasn't any better than my local neighborhood joint. based on what i read coming into the meal, i expected the light of god to shine down on me as i took my first bite. what i got instead was, yes, an ok pizza, but nothing more than and a ridiculously overcharged one at that (and now an awful case of heartburn, but that's beside the point).\n\nwe got the margherita pizza and added wood-roasted mushrooms and sicilian anchovies. sauce was pretty good but the house made mozzarella was nothing to write home about. crust was thin and soft in the middle, crispy around the edges...and burnt. luckily, my wife and i don't mind a well-done crust, but it certainly did not exhibit the perfection that i was expecting going in. the pizza was cut into 6 slices, and was so small that i could have easily eaten the thing on my own. couldn't have been more than 10-12\"""" in diameter, as each slice was able to *easily* fit on the same appetizer-sized plates that we used for our pre-pizza bread (which we had to request, was not offered to us by the waiter, yet another knock against the entire experience).\n\nthe total bill for one little pizza and a $5 draft beer was $28. that's right, one pizza, no more than a personal-sized one at that, with 2 toppings was $23. in terms of accompaniments to the pizza, the menu was SO limited and when i saw the table next to us get their antipasto plate, there was no way we were paying $15 for it.\n\ni cannot believe that anyone in their right mind would wait one hour, let alone up to 4 as some of you have written, for this pizza. maybe zagat should stick to fine dining reviews, b/c they clearly missed the mark here. if any of my friends or relatives were to visit phoenix, my advice would be \""""don't believe the hype\"""". personally, i can't wait to get back to new jersey and get a bigger, cheaper, and most importantly, better pizza.",0
"While on vacation in Vegas my friends and I wanted to unwind the night at a hookah lounge. Worst decision we made all trip. Lets start out by saying the employees there are horrible, constantly walking by and never once asking if we need anything or checking up on us. When we did finally get service they messed our drink up and had no explanation for the mess up but that they followed the measurements from a book. The bartender comes out and gives attitude but when he seen how mad we were he said he would comp us our drinks next round on the house. The bartender tried playing us for fools, comes out with 4 shots of papaya juice with not one single drop of alcohol in them. At this point we decided to leave, my friends wife goes to pay with the coupon they advertised and the host wouldn't except it saying they no longer advertise on that website even though my friends wife showed her the coupon on her phone and that it was still up and valid. Host responds by just saying I don't know what to tell you but we don't accept that coupon any longer. The entire evening was a disaster and the atmosphere was just horrible!! This would be the last place I would ever step foot in when in Vegas again.",0
"I have been to 56 North a couple of times in the past and never considered it anything special. However, after enjoying a gin masterclass here I now think there is something quite appealing about the bar. It's decided to give itself a niche and opted for gins from all over the joint in order to set the place apart from the competition. With comfortably over 100 gins on offer (as well as a cheeky wee off-licence), if the juniper berry floats your boat then this is the place to stop for a tipple. \n\nSaying that, if gin isn't your beverage of choice, there seems to be plenty other options on the drinks menu. I enjoyed several mulled wines here so there's lots of scope for drinky goodness. \n\nAmbience wise, it's a bit lacking in atmosphere. I think my winter visit and large glass frontage probably don't marry that well together. The seating is upright and table focused - not too cosy and laid back. Could do more with a couple of comfy couches and more booths. \n\nService was good. The guy that did the gin masterclass really knew his stuff and the barmen were friendly and polite. \n\nHaving not tried the food I can't comment on how good it is. But I'd be happy to come here again of an afternoon or evening and sample the drinks on offer.",1
"We are loyalty members because we like to travel a lot with our dog. Hands down this is the worst La Quinta we've ever stayed out. \n\nLong story, short: if you're NOT a smoker, don't stay here. This hotel is smoker friendly and every room and every hallway smells like it. Generally dirty and in need of upgrades and repairs, I'm surprised this hotel passes any sort of inspection. The air conditioning didn't work half of the time, and that's a nightmare in LV. \n\nIf you are members like us, stay at the AIRPORT LA QUINTA. Cheaper, quieter, a lot nicer, friendlier, and overall a better experience. \n\nLong story: we checked into this La Quinta in the afternoon. They were friendly and quickly put us into a room. When we got there, it smelled terrible. We are non smokers and it reeked of smoke. We called the front desk and they offered to move us. In the end, we moved rooms three times to finally get a roomed that we could \""""live with\"""". At $100 a night, I was not happy but we stayed. That evening, our air conditioner stopped working. We called the front desk again and ask for someone to come up. He did, but quickly said this is how this room is and left. Definitely the most unpleasant night in an uncomfortable bed in a room that was hot and gross. \n\nIn the morning, we cancelled our remaining nights and moved to the La Quinta Airport location. Easily the best thing we did!! They allowed us to check in at 10am, gave us an excellent room, and it was cheaper than the other hotel!!\n\nDo yourself a favor and stay at the airport location. Don't even bother with this LQ.",0
Awesome fast food. Beats the pants of Jollibee anyday! Siopao is killer. Can be price.....dinner for 2 can run up to 20 buxs and its only fast food. Get the monster halo halo. It's so worth it!,1
"This is the second time I've eaten here, and the quality of the service was pretty low both times. The first time, I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was packed (it was after a first friday event), and our waiter was preoccupied with a really annoying picky woman at the table next to us who kept demanding things. He was, shall I say, innattentive. Whatever, the food was really good, and despite cold drafts from the door, we had a pretty good time (although we would have ordered more drinks if we could have gottent the waiters attention). This last time was on Valentines day. I made a reservation and specifically asked to have a table away from the door. The guy taking my reservation confirmed that request, but when we showed up, the hostess put us RIGHT BY THE DOOR, even though there were several open tables. So I had to ask her to move us to one of those, which she begrudgingly did. The server we had was equally inattentive, even though the place wasn't particularly busy (even though it was Valentines day). We lacked some silver ware, and though we asked him for some, he never brought it. I had to go steal some fro one of the empty tables. The food was still really great, though, but I don't think I'll be heading back here...",0
"Overrated!! Carne asada is weak, they forgot to put their so called charred tomato salsa on our carne asada tacos?..Shrimp tacos are good, only one shrimp under all the toppings..Loud environment in the dining room and very uncomfortable chairs. The servers seemed nervous and one did crash a plate of food onto a table of people sitting a few feet away from us..Too much hype from locals who have not experienced real authentic eats in larger cities across the US and outside..",0
OMG!!!! By far the BEST pastries and bread I have EVER had. People in Montreal are so lucky to have this wonderful bakery place. Definitely must give this a try if you are in town. You will not regret it. The pastries just melt in your mouth. I LOVE this place.,1
I moved to Scottsdale about 6 months ago and I needed a good quality Nail Salon. I walked in without an appointment my first time and they assured me it would be a wait but offered me water and were very friendly. I have been to probably 12 out of the 17 techs they have there and I have NOT ONE complaint or concerns. Their pedicures are the best I've ever had and not to mention my gel/acrylic nails are to die for. They've given me so many amazing sets that I get compliments on them daily and I travel all over the U.S for work. I would highly recommend ProNails for an amazing experience. Julie and her team will take great care of you!,1
"This was my first visit here after recently moving to the Phoenix area this summer.  After living in CA, I have become accustomed to the being able to pop in local breweries for a beer and a bite...particularly in the San Diego area (incredible selection there, Stone is my favorite).  I really am trying to get into my local beers.  I enjoyed the Hope Knot IPA, so my wife surprised me for a lunch date at Four Peaks!  \n\nThe place was a little less polished than I imaged it would be, sort of a sports bar feel.  The food seletion looked good, typcial bar fare combined with some very unique selections.  We only order some pretzels...and I ordered the taster set so that I could explore their full line of beers.  The beer was good overall, not the best I have had.  I still think the Hop Knot is one of their best, and their ales are strong as well.  \n\nThe best thing about this place was the incredible service.  Despite the super casual feel, the service was fantastic.  Our server covered every detail, offered wonderful suggestions and check on us often.  When I asked about the building and beer production, she fetched the manager (Mike), who was very gracious to take the time to tell us more about the brewery (the building dates back to the 19th century!).  \n\nVery much enjoyed our lunch, I would come back with some of my buddies for a beer anytime.",1
I regret not trying every pastry they offered. I just didn't have enough time. I ate here 5 times at least in 2 weeks. They were so yummy no matter what time we arrived. Man I regret not trying every chocolate and pastry they offered.,1
"I came here because it was a recommendation from one of my good friends.  She was shocked about my experience here.\n\nMy first visit was just a simple xray, check up and cleaning.  I was told I needed to get a crown and to fill some cavities.  Dr. Frantz insisted that I needed a crown ASAP due to the cavity size and what not on my tooth.  I wanted to give it some more thought.  But I went ahead and made a second appointment to get my cavities filled.  \nI do have to say I thought the the procedure went well for getting my cavities filled.  But here's the downfall on the second visit.  As I was leaving, I was expecting to pay for my copays for the filings. No problem, BUT I was also billed for a cleaning I had the 1st visit.  Apparently it was not the typical normal cleaning by the hygienist.\n\n I told her, I was NOT aware or informed about that the cleaning they gave me on my 1st visit and that I was going to be billed more for it.  So If you want to be billed WITHOUT giving verbal or written consent to the procedure they are going to do to you.. THIS IS THE PLACE. The receptionist could only give me a :shrug: and a half smile as a response. It wasn't the receptionist's fault. She was just doing her job.  \n\nI have not replaced that tooth that needed a crown in 3 months. I've had no issues with that particular tooth and had 2 second opinions saying there was no urgency to replace my current tooth with a crown. So thanks Dr. Frantz for thanks for trying to scare me so I can give you more money.",0

"The only thing that this place sells are truffles, and they tasted extremely bitter and nothing like what the specified flavors suggested. Wouldn't recommend at all! Each truffle is priced at $2.00 a piece, I'd recommend going to Walmart and getting truffles instead, being that they actually taste good.",0
I have NEVER had a worse pedicure. The girl that was doing my pedicure could not even be bothered to Rub in all the lotion on my legs. She was very fast with zero attention to detail.,0
"This place is AWESOME!  I'd recommend everyone take management's advice and try your entree with the chef's hair...it truly is something you won't get anywhere else (we'll...you'll get it here and there, but mgmt probably won't promote it).  \n\nIf you are slightly adventurous like me, order the clay pot with beef stew and turnip.  When I got mine, there was a hair on one of the turnips in the stew (I'm definitely one of the lucky ones...don't be jealous Lana Del Rey!).  No big deal, i get that it happens...so I wait until my waitress checks on us and point out the hair.  The waitress then picks up the pot for a close inspection and acknowledges that it is truly human hair (good thing she did, since my vision at age 34 is deteriorating quickly).  She then holds the pot, looks at me, and asks what I would like her to do (she is young..i'm guessing in her early 20's, speaks English fluently, probably grew up in Phoenix and is part of the restaurant owner's family, at least to my understanding).  Since she is new to this culture of 'eating out at a restaurant', I advise her that my preference is for the kitchen to re-make me the dish.  The waitress gives me a stunned look (since I am asking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow) and tells me that the hair is only on one turnip.  She then puts the clay pot back on the table, and provides me her advice.  She (and Confucius) says that I should simply remove the turnip with the hair from the stew and continue eating the dish.  (Whoop, there is it!).  \n\nMy first reaction was that this was crazy, but then I realized... the human hair was actually being used as an ingredient in giving flavor to the stew/broth.  Although not meant to be eaten, it was one of the magical ingredients that made the food at Nee House special.  No wonder the waitress looked at me like I was a leprechaun (and not the lucky charms type, more like the scary 90's movie version...you know the one they did so many sequels of)!\n\nWell, it is May, but Happy St. Patty's Day, and go check out Nee House!  It is a dining experience you won't forget.  \n\nTip: Keep your fingers crossed you get the early 20's female waitress (I think she's the only one in that age group working as a waitress there).  She will make sure you get the royal treatment.",0
Luis is awesome! A++++ service! Highly recommended. Quality work on my carpets. Shows up on time and is a man of his word.  I have a dog who stinks and sheds and he made everything look and smell brand new. Thanks so much!,1
"Check-in Quick Tip: Still a line 30 min before closing. Crazy!\n\nIt was the last night we had in Vegas, and amazingly we did not go to any buffets. Actually, I don't think I've been to a buffet in a REALLY long time, but boyfriend suggested we go to this one with my brother and his fiance.\n\nI looked it up on Yelp since we weren't 100% sure where this was located, and I read the reviews and was sold. I told my brother's fiance about it and she was quite interested in it as well. \n\nAt about 9pm (we called earlier and found out they close at 10pm), we drove out to Henderson and were a little bit worried we wouldn't make it in time to eat. We didn't think there would be such a long line, but lo and behold...there wasn't, but a line there still was. \n\nThe cashier told us that the food would stop being served at 1030pm, which wasn't too bad since it was roughly around 930. We just needed to get our buttocks in there to begin feasting. \n\nMy brother told us he was going to stack plates with food and create his own buffet line at our table. And he was so not kidding because that's exactly what he did lol\n\nThe buffet spot looks amazing. It's spaced out with huge TV's located near the entrance, and the all you can drink beer and wine was totally awesome. Granted I didn't take advantage of that, but the idea itself is pretty cool. The boyfriend went nuts with the root beer haha\n\nEvery dish I tasted was fresh. The shrimp cocktails, the baked mussels, the cheese tortellini; they even had chicken ADOBO! Omg, for buffet food....that was pretty damn good. chicken was so tender and so flavorful (is that a word?). The chow mein didn't taste as oily as some other places, and the sushi was pretty decent. It didn't fall apart as you were putting it into your mouth, nor was it too big that it couldn't fit into it.\n\nI would definitely come back to this buffet place, and i hope that all the hype it may be getting from other folks doesn't cause others' expectations to become extremely high. \n\nJust know that it's good, and worth the price. Just go there expecting a long line, but realize that it's worth it. :)",1
"Love, love, loved Roaring Fork! \n\nThe dining room is warm and cozy, with lots of wood and stone in the decor. Usually a Southwestern theme like theirs can come across as pretty casual, but they manage to make it feel like a classic, upscale lodge and touches like lovely crystal and white table cloths lend to the appropriate high end atmosphere.\n\nBased on other great reviews, we started with the Kettle of Green Chile Pork, which was as amazing as expected. The amount of pork served was more than the initial serving of tortillas could accommodate, so we needed to request seconds so that we could scrape the bottom of the kettle and finish every last delicious tidbit.\n\nOur entrees were the Boneless Buttermilk Fried Chicken (mine), Sugar Cured Duck Breast (hubby) and Rainbow Trout (friend) All were delicious - I particularly loved the peppercorn gravy with my Fried Chicken, which was full of flavor. The Duck that my husband had was melt-in-your mouth tender and flavorful, and the skin on my friend's Trout was too good to leave on the plate (she normally bypasses it but instead it was her favorite part!) \n\nWe did order a side of the Green Chili Mac n Cheese which was good, but not life changing.\n\nMy memory is a bit fuzzy after all of that amazing food, but I believe we had a huckleberry bread pudding for dessert, which was a great way to end a super yummy meal. \n\nService was good - not overwhelmingly personal, but attentive and nice.\n\nMy hubby works just around the corner, so we nee to head back again very soon :)",1
"The pizza here alone is worth coming for.  Stone fire pizza is always a yes in my book!  Everything about our pizza was good from the mushrooms, sausage, shrimp, and sauce.  We also ordered the duck sandwich and lasagetta.  Duck sandwich was a bit too sweet for me, nothing super special I can say about it.  Lasagetta ... turned out NOT to be lasagna as we thought..it was little sausage pieces that covered veggies and thick lasagna pasta.. no sauce, no go if you ask me.  I would definately come back for the pizza!",1
Wow!  I had tried their beer at Tap & Bottle and wanted to check out their brewery on a recent trip to Phoenix and surrounding areas.  We LOVED it.  Their menu is varied and unique and good!  From their beer braised & bleu burger to french cut wings and green chile pork sliders we tried them all and left barely able to move.  And the beer!  We started with the Refuge IPA and hardly were able to stray from that.  I believe we sampled a RyePA too but the Refuge was our favorite.  We enjoyed ourselves so much on our first day that a couple days later we made the detour again so we could stop back in on our way home.  This time we filled our stomachs and a growler to go - and threw in a couple shirts.  Can't wait to be back.,1
"You Say Potato, I Say Chicago\nBy The Rue\n\nOld Chicago is where I ate,\nI would probably by lying,\nIf I said it was great.\n\nLunch special calzone for $7.99,\nBy the time I left there,\nMy big hairy belly was doing fine.\n\nYou're probably thinking \""""eww that's nasty\"""",\nLike Magnum P.I. it rules,\nThe waitress wasn't sweet or sassy. \n\nInside that finely browned bread pouch,\nI had it stuffed with pineapple and jalapeno,\nUnfortunately my mouth didn't say \""""ouch\"""". \n\nIf you're reading this and rolling your eyes,\nIt's okay, I'm not here to entertain you,\nI'm just here to eat pies. \n\nEnd",1
"Went back because a friend had a groupon.  Technically, it was a groupon wannabe from VoicePlaces.  We skipped the buffet and ordered off the menu.  We tried once of each Jamaican pattie flavor (beef, spinach, jerk chicken, curry chicken), and made 2 safe sandwich choices (jerk chicken and jerk turkey burger).\n\nThe patties were all tasty, and they were a good value at only $2 each.  I particularly liked the curry chicken and the spinach flavors.  The sandwiches were disappointing... very small with no side dishes for $6 each.  The waiter threw in a free order of \""""festivals\"""" for us, but they weren't as festive as one would imagine.  They were just fried dough and empty calories.  Think beignets without any powdered sugar.\n\nSo, it's worth checking out this place for the $2 patties and $1 beers during happy hour ($2 Red Stripe), but that's about it.  Nothing else seemed outstanding or a great value, and the ambience leaves something to be desired.",0
Tried 3 diff dishes..all were below avg at best.  Too expensive for bland food.,0
I will start by saying great food and amazing salsa... However worst service and slowest wait staff I've ever encountered. It's not even busy in here. I ordered a beer literally 20 min ago and still haven't gotten it. Also the salsa is brought in a lil carafe and nothing to poor it in. Very odd and puts the patron in a difficult situation to figure out.,0
"I went here for the first time this past Friday, it was okay.  Very crowded (which we expected), parking was a little bit of a hassle (again, expected) but the food was good.  \nI ordered from the burger truck (I can't remember the name of it..) and got the Cali burger with avocado, grilled pineapple and cheese.  It was delicious!  The pineapple really added a nice flavor to it and the burger was cooked medium just like I requested. \nBut, we waited over 15 minutes for our food.  It was awkward trying to hear the names called.  The lines everywhere were so long and I really didn't see much on the menus that stood out to me. \n\nOverall, the food was good but for a $13 hamburger and french fry meal, I would rather get it somewhere that I didn't have to stand in line for 20 minutes and then wait another 15 for the food.",0
Oh my goodness this place is good! My husband and I have been here for over a year and I regret to say this was our first visit! We have been missing out on great service and excellent burgers! I will come back here probably every week until we move again! I highly recommend you try it!,1
Decent store. Good selection. The 20% restocking fee on return items is a big no-no however. That sort of thing really shouldn't even be legal.,0
"HORRIBLE! We went here to celebrate my dad's 50th bday with a party of 13. Our server Mayra was the worst! She forgot 2 of our entrees which didn't come out til the rest of us were all done eating and I asked her if they did anything for bdays and she bluntly said no. I then complained to the manager about the horrible service and he then tells me that they do give a free dessert with a candle if it's someone's bday. I don't get why she would say no?! Racist?! And to top it off, at the end if our dinner she said 'happy birthday' to the wrong person! Anyway, end of story is we're never coming back!",0
Their coffee is amazing. The staff was friendly.  The place was very cool decorated.  Would love to come back to have another one soon.,1
"Stratta, you know you're in the Wynn right? \nwent with a large party, and they were the only ones that could accomodate. \n\nFood was overall OK, but wasn't worth it. \nclam appetizer: tasted great\nSteak: solid but expensive\nBlack Bass: looked better than it tasted\nPastas: looked and tasted like they were microwaved packaged and tossed in a bowl\nPork Chop: incredibly salty and both orders were sent back\n\nGo somewhere else, Wynn/Encore dining is usually much better than this.",0
Wells Fargo never owns there errors. Called Twice to order debit card. Not once was it ordered. Horrible Customer Service at the call centers rushed off the phone and quickly hung up on after they said they would send it. 3 weeks later still no card. asked them to rush it due to me being inconvenienced by them they just told me to go to the branch. Spoke to supervisor Told me the same thing. so now its going to over 30 days with out a card. and i work during there business hours.\n \nWELLS FARGO YOU SUCK!   Sucks Im not rich. poor people never get the breaks.,0
"Eh asada burrito was unimpressive and bordering on bad but I also adjusted since it's airport food...  Also, it was closing very soon, so maybe it was just a bad batch.\n\nUnfortunately won't recommend =P",0
"My wife Annie and I have gone to Pinnacle since day 1 and always enjoy the food and the people.  Dawn, Josh, Jason are really nice.  We were so glad they were only closed 1 week to repair their walk in cooler.  We were very sad there was so much mis information regarding the temp. closure.  I assure you it was NOT due to anything being unclean.  It is basic...If your walk in cannot keep food cold then you cannot risk storing food.  They did what any responsible business would do.  Just because the words \""""health dept\"""" was on the sign does not mean anything bad.  Whomever Richard D. is with his ignorant review.....well, there are assholes everywhere.   We love this place .  Andrew and annie gervase",1
Grilled cheese with pesto was amazing. One of the best I've tasted. My friend and I had the same dish. We asked to substitute fries for the salad and they brought us fries and salad but no soup (which the dish comes with) but they quickly rectified the situation and brought us the soup. Really delicious!,1
"my waiter is the only reason im giving 2 stars. he tried his best but the food plain sucks. I orders spaghetti and meatballs, He told me (im sure he is forced to) the soup was house made as well as the noodles. the noodles are NOT HOUSE MAD, and the soup was canned soup with extra stuff added.",0
"Overpriced to the extreme. Minus a star. \nWent on Friday night around 930... had to wait 20 min for a table.\n\nI had their very BASIC mixed green salad with citrus vinagarette... $15 for a plain salad. WHY. \nThen I had their Stracchino Ravioli with nametake mushrooms in some kind of citrus butter sauce... MEH. The ravioli was BLAND, the mushrooms were unseasoned and raw which I guess was what they were supposed to be, but it didn't go well with the dish. AT ALL. And the sauce was kind of bizarre for a ravioli dish. IDK. Minus a star.\nMy mom was forced to order a goat cheese ravioli because they RAN OUT of their spaghetti with one pound lobster. WTF. FAIL. \nMy dad got the beef cheek ravioli which was actually delicious. Too bad it wasn't MY order.\nMy sister got orchiette with sausage and brocollini (can't remember the real name, this was all translated from the fancy italian they actually use on the menu) which was decent I suppose... for $29 bucks...\n\nOur waiter was meh, he was pushy and forgot my dad's side order of potatoes. Didn't really even apologize. It's okay, we didn't want $10 potatoes that were prob just plain potatoes in olive oil and rosemary. Minus a star.The bus boys were prompt and funny though. Maybe they should trade places with our waiter... \n\nBasically everything is above $25 and for small portions. Our waiter said \""""typically\"""" a person orders an appetizer, first course (pasta), second course and then dessert. But total that would be over $100 a person guarantee and we weren't feeling it. \n\nOVERALL: not worth it. Splurge at a different place. Sorry, Mario. Maybe you and your crocs should roll up to this restaurant to change it up.\n\nI will say that their Bellini (peach puree + prosecco) was yummy and maybe the best thing I had at dinner. But that was a $12 cocktail. SAD.",0
"2 stars bcuz I like McDonald's no matter what but dang-- fast food does not equal bad customer service. We ordered big so naturally, you would think a big bag would be in order but no. carrying the bag into the house, it ripped. I ordered the #11 (Fish Filet) and it never fails that the fish is never centered on the bun. We asked for sweet & sour sauce n grabbing it out of the bag, my girlfriend found it to be open already! ick! :( bad experiences = less customers. Make sure everything is in order before you leave.",0
"We returned to Carmines, this time with a different group of 6. Again they honored their reservation and sat us immediately. We were there on a Thursday night. They have a steak special for around $90. There was probably enough on the plate to have only that for dinner. The steak was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly (we ordered it to be pink). It came with lots of veggies on the platter - no need to order sides with this. Unfortunately we did not appreciate just how much food would be on the plate. We did not come close to finishing it.\nThis group is generally pretty tough to pleasse. Each person loved the meal.\nI will be returning to Carmines.",1
"Oh, US Airways.... You miserable pile of shit! You've stolen a star when you truly deserve a big fat 0. This review is being written in the thick of it. My husband still has not made his connection.... His connecting flight from Charlotte to San Francisco was cancelled. He should have left the airport about 6 hours ago. First, they told him his only option was tomorrow morning... Instead of delaying for 18 hours and sleeping in the USO, he opted for standby on the next flight. The schedule showed two more (direct) flights out for today. We're still waiting for the damn thing to stop being delayed. This next 'mystery' flight out of theirs has been delayed five times... We got close with that last one, though... The bastards waited until seven minutes before boarding to give it another 1 hour stretch! We're both seeing red! \n\nPlain as day, all of these reviews just scream DO NOT FLY US AIRWAYS OR UNITED!!!! \n\nAll of them have their problems. This isn't the only airline that we've missed a flight, been delayed, or had cancel on us. But the succeeding bullshit has been enough to tip the scales. I will never fly, recommend, or rate in favor of these airlines again.",0
I take my vehicle into Wilhelm for oil changes and necessary car repairs. I have always found the front desk and mechanics to be extremely helpful and friendly. My family and I are natives and have always taken our vehicles to Wilhelm. I wouldn't think of going any other place. I would HIGHLY recommend to them to anyone!,1
"I came back a 2nd time and brought a different friend with us.  We still came on a Saturday at around 11 am and while it was busy, we got seated right away.  I went big and got the Wolfpack Club which is the original Wolfpack but more bacon, an extra layer of hash browns and 2 more eggs.  The price of this bad boy was $16.50.  The original Wolfpack sells for $8.99 (I believe).  I was full but was it worth the money?  Kind of.  Instead of cheese it was topped it with I'd rather have the country sausage gravy on it instead.  So for $16.50, I'm going to get the Wolfpack (PlanetCabo style).  I will get the Wolfpack minus the cheese and get an order of biscuits and gravy and marry the 2 together. BAM!  A star is born.\n\nOne of these days I will try their brioche french toast but my new concoction is calling me first.",1
"Went to El Pollo Loco today, ordered a salad..took it home and most of the lettuce was brown and black and close to moldy. Took it back to the store and the manager Julio Martinez with no apology said this is what happens to lettuce sometimes. I asked him if this was acceptable to serve to guests and he said yes. Asked him again and he said yes.  The first thing out of his mouth should have been I'm so sorry what can I do to fix this. But instead he blamed the lettuce and that this is normal. OMG!!!! I am not going to let this one go, called his supervisor and corporate. Unreal",0
"This place is such a great deal!  Sometimes there isn't a great variety, but if you don't see the dish that you want on the conveyor belt, you can request it from the sushi chefs.  They're really nice & accomodating.  They'll ask you how many plates you want too.  I usually only request one, and they put the rest of that roll on the conveyor belt.\n\nMy favorites include:\n-Hawaiian roll: spicy tuna topped w/ tuna\n-Spicy crab & shrimp roll\n-Haru sushi: two pieces of tuna wrapped around imitation crab & topped with a few slices of avocado\n-Haru popper (mispelled 'poper'): tempura-fried stuffed jalapenos\n-Crunchy California roll: I only eat this if it's topped w/ eel sauce (they should have a bottle of it there for you)\n-Vegas roll\n\nThe asparagus roll isn't good.  I've only tried it once, and refuse to try it again.  The rice was dry & so was the asparagus.\n\nI would say the quality of the fish isn't as good/fresh as Mido Sushi or Kabuki, but hey, it's only $1-$2 a plate!  Being a petite little Asian girl, I usually eat about 6 plates on my own.\n\nThe wait is terrible during dinner hours, especially on a Friday night.  However, the good part about this place (other than price) is that once you get table, you can immediately grab plates off of the conveyor belt!  I always end up grabbing at least two plates before actually sitting down & getting utensils from the waiter. :)",1
"Took yelper's advice and got the delicious pork belly & japanese lasagna, I also ordered my favorites agadashi tofu, tuna poke salad, & miso black cod and they were prepared excellently. We arrived early so it was kind of quiet and we received excellent friendly service. Finished our meal with the tempura ice cream (also delicious) and looking forward to our next visit.",1
improved from it's previous version. The asian section was not up to par.,1
"I would give it no stars if I could. They don't clean the rooms during your stay. They told us that they only clean them every 4 days. That is absolutely disgusting and should be a health violation. Needless to say, we ended up eating our costs and leaving early. \n\nSTAY AWAY, FAR AWAY!!!",0
"I love WinCo! The prices are a lot cheaper than Wal Mart even, and the quality is better. This store is exceptionally clean and organized. The staff is pretty friendly, too!",1
This place is ridiculous. There was a waiting list when we arrived. We put our name in and decided to wait the hour. Right on the dot the hostess called to say they could not accommodate us due to a party of 60. Why could they not tell us that when we checked in they made us wait the hour exactly and then decided to call and tell us. Then the. Douche of a manager came out after we asked for him and asked how our night was? Really. You're such a Schmuck. You should not be employed as a manager dealing with the public. I will not be back or ever recommend this place to anyone.,0
"I usually visit this place when I am in Karlsruhe. I like the atmosphere, the coffee, the vast selection of newspapers & magazines, and the fact that no one will mind if you spend hours over a cup of coffee or two, reading one newspaper or mag after the other. The perfect place to relax after dodging the trams that go down Kaiserstrasse.\n\n\n I can't speak for the food as this is a coffee joint for me but I doubt it is that bad since I have often seen people eating here.\n\n\n Very close to the Karlsruhe castle gardens if you fancy a post-coffee stroll.",1
"Their chili burger with cheddar is terrific! Their onion rings have a light cornmeal batter, so they're more onion-y and crispier than onion rings you'd find at most burger places. With one of their many kinds of root beer, this meal combo was fantastic. Love this place!",1
Although I wanted to stay here I never ended up staying due to the reservations department.  The front page of their website prominently lists multiple package promotions.  After unsuccessfully trying to book the promotion from the website I called the reservation phone number.  The lady on the phone told me that all of the packages showed no availability on any day of any month so she would override it for me in the system.  I wasn't sure what package I wanted to I told her I would call back.  When I called back I got a different person on the phone and she refused to give me the package price.  I asked to speak with the supervisor and when I was connected to Enrique he told me I should have booked with the first agent and refused to give me the package price even though it continues to be advertised on the front page of the website.  I feel this is not only bad customer service but also bait-and-switch as they actively advertise packages that they have no intention o giving you.,0
"A nice museum, an interesting Hollywood themed exhibit, and a pleasant first ever art museum visit with a group of young adults -- all ruined by an exhibit attendant drunk with the power of his polo shirt and name tag. The obnoxious prick who was working on the third floor of the south building today should find something else to do. Cultivating art appreciation is not his forte, nor is working with the public. Thanks for permanently turning off my 17-24 year olds from art by confirming the stereotype of \""""art museum\"""" as a snooty and uninviting place where they do not belong and are not welcome.",0
"After getting stranded in a storm while biking, a friend and I ended up here as refuge until the storm passed. We were pretty disappointed on all fronts.\n\nThe worst aspect was the service: the dining room was about 3/4 full, but our waitress was difficult to find when we were ready to order and when we wanted the check.\n\nThe atmosphere was also pretty terrible. In addition to the tacky decorations and awkward floor layout (some tables in the bar area, some in the recreation area, nothing really aligned), the other patrons that were there were loud and rude. I guess this is Madison's version of a dive bar?\n\nThe food had no redeeming quality. My friend got the $9 Caesar salad, which consisted of a minimal amount of romaine lettuce and Caesar dressing. Not even croutons?! For $9, I expect at least some veggies or toppings on the salad. Note that for $3 more, you can get chicken on top, but I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\nI got sweet potato fries which were ok, but were clearly frozen.\n\nAvoid at all costs unless this place cleans up their act.",0
"Huge portions and long waits are the name of the game here.  It was about 30 minute wait for us - not too bad, I suppose.  \n\nThey don't use plates here - think PLATTERS, obesity and the answer to why Europeans are more healthy than us!\n\nI ordered the delicious bacon avocado swiss and onion scramble with their crispy potatoes and a biscuit w/freshly made strawberry jam. I recommend forgoing those and trying the griddled mashed potatoes.  I found the crispy potatoes flavorless and boring.  The biscuit and strawberry jam were divine, however.\n\nThey have a full bar and feature some Midwestern kitsch - such as Milwaukees Best in a brown bag as one of the menu items.  Love the attitude on the menu.\n\nThe server almost messed up the order and gave my scramble to a couple who had just arrived.  It was corrected quickly. \n\nDefinitely worth the drive from the Strip, but if you're looking for a good breakfast and looking to get away from the casinos, save your money and try Blueberry Hill.   I think that's a better value.",1
Great food. Nice service. \n\nHad the ribeye wish garlic mash. So good. Also the crab artichoke dip! Walked in on a Wednesday after our flight and we were seated right away! Restaurant has a nice ambiance.,1
"Not a huge fan.. I mean, the prices are ok, and the store is your typical sally's. It's clean and all.. But the employees, while generally polite, don't seem to have a clue what they're doing. I returned a box of straightening treatment after reading the reviews online. Half of them claimed this stuff ruined their hair. I wasn't really wanting to chance that, so I took it back. I told the lady why I was returning it and she got really snippy at me, letting me know that of course it wouldn't ruin my hair; they wouldn't sell it if it did! Err.. Ok, I guess all those people with ruined hair are totally wrong. Whatever. You ask for help choosing a product.. And not a single person there actually knows anything about their products. I don't normally expect employees to know much about their products.. But you ONLY sell hair care and styling supplies... You would think they'd know a LITTLE something about the products they stare at all day long. But whatever, I'm sure I'll continue to shop here; I just won't bother with  expecting service.",0
"This place is really great! The food was affordable and good quality. I write a travel blog and I'm always looking for ways to save money or find delicious authentic food. The burritos were around 5.60 and for an additional $3 you can add a \""""sopapilla\"""" and 2 sides. My grandmother is from New Mexico and they had some dishes I remember eating when I was a child, like the chile verde stew with shredded beef chunks. \n\nOverall a great place, if you live in the area or have a car while visiting I suggest taking a ride over to try it out. \n\nIf you want more tips on restaurants, hotels and shows check out my blog at http://letsjetset.com",1
"Vitacost is great for buying vitamins and homeopathic remedies at a discounted rate. But if you ever need to deal with their customer service, that is another story all together. It is terrible.\nI ordered some yum-yum dophilus, which arrived with everything else I had ordered in a box. I gave it to my daughter. All seemed good.\nThe next time I ordered the yum-yum dophilus, it came in a packed in freezer packs. Only then did I notice that is small letters it says to keep refrigerated.\nI called up to get my first order replaced, because if it was supposed to be refrigerated, it certainly lost some of its potency being stuck in a truck in the HOT Las Vegas sun. The first woman I spoke with told me that her manager would call me back, which never happened. The second time I called, I spoke to a woman, who said that the yum-yum dophilus would be fine, even though it had been on a truck in the HOT Las Vegas sun and then the HOT LA sun. And she wouldn't give me a credit or replace the initial box.\nSo if you use vitacost.com know that you are getting discounted good and horrid customer service.",0
"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!!!  DO NOT buy a groupon from this place. I walked in the Solon to find no one at the front, after waiting for more than 15 minutes someone finally comes. I asked if there's was any openings for mani and pedi she said yes at noon but as soon as I mentioned a had a groupon suddenly they couldn't do it. I asked to speak to the manager she said she was the manger. She was very RUDE and aggressive she refused to give any information about the owner.

"OK, so this WAS my favorite restaurant in Vegas.  Now?  Not so much.  I just went here with a friend - we were looking forward to a great experience.  Not so this time.  The service was the worst I've ever experienced.  The food - some good, some bad.  On service I would give this 1 star, but the food saved it.  \n\nWe started with the stuffed portabello appetizer - pretty good.  I ordered a salad and my friend ordered the lobster bisque.  The lobster bisque was horrible!  Instead of a subtle lobster flavor it had a fowl fishy smell with a sharp metallic after-taste.  We sat and waited for our waiter to come by and check on us so we could return the soup - he completely ignored us.  I was confident he would return to at least offer some fresh pepper for my salad.  I was wrong.  The pepper grinder made it to other tables from other waiters, but our guy just kept returning to the bar to check the hockey score, and disappeared in the back room.  At one point I thought I caught his eye as I was trying to wave him down, but he turned around and went to another table.  Seriously, how can you just drop food in front of people and not ever go back to see if they need anything - fresh pepper, or whatever.  Finally he came by to see if we were done eating, and at that point I told him that the soup was inedible, and he took it away with no apologies.  When the manager came by, I told the manager the same, and I got \""""we're looking into it\"""" back.  We're looking into it?  What the heck does that mean?\n\nNow, the entrees came and they were good.  I had a steak and my friend had the Chicken Kiev.  Quite tasty.  But then I was surprised that the waiter didn't come back to check on us.  The manager did, which was nice.  The waiter came by when we were done.  \n\nKudos to the restaurant for a good appetizer and entrees, but shame on them for such horrible service.  Will I go back?  Hmmm...maybe after a while.  I'll give them some time to fix their service, because this used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas (I previously gave them 5 stars) and it would be a pity never to go back.  But for now I'm still shocked at the horrible service.",0
"LAME, I came for an internet special and even after showing it to my server did not honor it due to the fact that no manger was available. BAD REVIEWS ARE A BITCH!",0
"Breakfast food an I have become good friends since I realized I was lactose intollerant. For some reason I have been eating a lot more eggs since cutting out dairy. So, a friend and I took a drive down from the resort we were staying at. We found scramble at the recommendation of some friends. I'm glad we went.\n\nNothing beats a fresh, hot, delicious egg scrambled full of veggies and bacon. This accented with small wheat pancakes and crispy potatoes is a sure hit. The breakfast blend coffee was great. My friend is allergic to dairy, wheat and doesn't eat meat. She was able to come out of there with quite a spread. This was truly a morning miracle.\n\nI have to say that scramble has increased the quality of my friendship with breakfast. It was one of the best breakfast places I have visited. And they utilize local, fresh ingredients which only adds to the experience. If you go and you have a dog, they can come along too. Another added bonus. They do close at 2pm though.",1
"I\""""m not into crafts, but I noticed that this place took over an old department store, near PV Mall, so I decided to stroll around.

Michael's cannot be happy that this place is in the neighborhood.  Martha Stewart chicks have a new hangout.",1
Tripe stew is delicious.,1
"Eating at this place is like riding a psychotic horse towards a burning stable! \nWent with group of 28 we all got sat behind the bar. Menu was preset that was fine but from here on out a disaster appitizer round was good but table next to us get served apps they start to eat them.. Server then comes back says opps not your food they pick up three trays and take it directly to another table not in our party! After we had eaten off it!! Wow!  The we get to salad course, our table 12 people the served 3 small salads for us all to eat. We ask server and he said that's all the kitchen made.. Ok we rack rolled off a few berries and laughed.. Entry's start to arrive all of us out of water and drinks.. All get food except two of us. 10 min later ask server and his answer is to look around and find one on another table and other and end of our table so he grabs them and puts them in front of us.. Again already been eaten on by other people. Now I ask for manager telling him what's going on (manager with Beard) who in forms me that I have it all wrong and since I am not the host who is paying go sit down!! Your kidding me right? So bake to my seat still no one has water or drinks our whole table of 12 gets up and goes to the bar. We never went back for last course nor did they serve it. Entertainment was band in the bar room and we asked about the back and we were told by bartender they shut it down because being sued by another hotel. So... Please don't waist your time here service worst I have ever seen manager who could give a shit and no entertainment!",0
"I've stayed here many times when I was little, but the place has definitely lost its novelty in my eyes now that I come to Vegas for different, 21+ reasons :P For families, this place is great - there is a whole floor dedicated to carnival-like games and children can have lots of fun (but will probably waste a lot of your money!) playing the games in order to win stuffed animals.\n\nIf you're 21+, this is definitely not a good place to stay in Vegas.\nIt's on the outskirts of The Strip, so it's not easy to get anywhere - the Wynn/Encore is a couple blocks away but you are still far from everything else. \nThe food in the hotel is very mediocre.\nThe gambling in the hotel also really sucks - the blackjack tables have a $5 minimum, which is lower than most places in Vegas, BUT they only deal 1 deck, so it's almost always in the dealer's favor. You can lose a lot of money that way. People also don't really seem to come here for anything other than slots, because even the poker room only had 1 full table when I came, compared to the Venetian or even Encore, which had hella. \n\nGood thing my friends and I weren't staying here during our trip!",0
"What a disappointment!  I don't even want to do this review!  When we first arrived, there was a lot of  people waiting to be seated.  So when we got to the hostess, she took our name, and we decided to sit and have a drink.  As were sitting there, we noticed there were plenty of seats available.  I guess they want you to think there that busy...DUHHHH, I can see all the tables that are clean and available!  What ever!  So we get called for our table about 15 min later.  \nAs I'm looking at the menu, nothing really looked good to me!  Well except for the stuffed mushrooms, and a lobster pizza!  I went with the mushrooms, they were really good.  There biscuits seemed too salty!  Wow, I like some seasoning on my food, but DAYMMMM!   Since we really didn't seem that hungry (I think the menu just turned us off)  We decided to do the 2 for $25.00 Bad choice.  I got the seafood linguini, ughhhh, like I could have made this at home!  There was nothing special about this it wasn't even worth $3.99l  My husband ordered Honey Garlic Crispy Shrimp!  Ummm, when you say crispy, your expecting some crunch, right?  His shrimp was soggy, and the rice was weird, I love rice!  I didn't even like it!  \n\nI will be back, because there lunch menu seems so much better!  Not only that, I should have just gotten the lobster pizza!  This will be my last visit, if they don't have there game on point!",0
"Greenstar Eco did an adequate job the first time the serviced my yard.  We have desert landscaping with several bushes, a small patch of grass and fruit trees. After the first visit they barely stayed 20 minutes.  Our bushes were not maintained and we had to repeatedly ask them to perform routine yard maintenance. They started coming later in the day and then suddenly 2 weeks ago they stopped showing up.  We were given no notice of a delay so we called; the receptionist gave us an excuse that the account manager was sick. It came out later that they were trying to outsource our yard since we are in Avondale.  We did not hear back after another week.  Needless to say we found another landscaper who does more for us with no need for direction.  We have advised Greenstar to stop shopping landscapers to sell our contract to; we no longer require their less than professional service.",0
Great selection with decent prices. Free wifi and a decent rewards card. Great lunch date place! A lot of children but that could be a pro or con!,1
"Horrible, over priced, worse than Dennys in terms of quality- and they tacked on a to-tax and mandatory tip for a sandwich to go!!! \n\nBeware!",0

"This airlines now flies out of Sky Harbor, but I would generally concur with the 2-star overall rating of this airlines. Yes, the prices are rock-bottom (even for last-minute booked flights), which is the ONLY reason anyone would ever want to consider flying with this business. Because you can expect every single flight to be delayed at least one hour. (That's been my experience after about a half-dozen flights.) And even though their website is up-to-date on flight times, if an incoming plane lands, they will quickly shuttle you onto that plane (calling \""""All zones\"""") like scurrying rats, and you may actually leave BEFORE the time posted on their website. So beware if you think you have a boatload of time before takeoff only to find out the flight has already left the terminal when you arrive at your departure gate!\n\nMy most-recent flight  experience was like eating fresh fish from the latest oil-spill incident. The flight was (as usual) initially posted as delayed more than an hour, but that wasn't the big problem. Which occurred after the flight we were waiting on finally arrived, and we passengers were herded onto that plane like a fast-rushing river (presumably so we wouldn't arrive as late getting to our destination); where most of us then proceeded to sit on the plane - packed like 12 oz. of sardines jammed into 8 oz. cans - in just 5 airplane rows (while the rest of the seats on the entire plane were nearly empty) for two solid two hours before taking off! That, given very limited legroom on this airline, was not much fun. (Especially since we still had a 3-hour flight still ahead of us.) \n\nI'm not sure if this is a common practice with this airlines or not to have people sit on a plane for hours prior to takeoff, but to rush passengers onto the plane like a mad dash to get out of a burning building, and then have us sit packed together like roll of coins for two hours seemed (to me) to indicate a serious lack of good judgment on the part of the employees of this airlines; to even have the passengers board in the first place (for a flight that wouldn't be taking off for another two hours) was (in my opinion) a mistake.  \n\nFor it was only the AFTER the plane was leaving that we were told the plane (flying out of Minneapolis) suddenly needed to be \""""de-iced,\"""" but (I ask you) wasn't this fact known to this airlines BEFORE the mad dash of passengers onto the plane? And this is what took 2 solid hours for us to finally take off? Also, we were specifically instructed not to move to other seats until after takeoff (but that turned out to be two hours later) to \""""balance\"""" out the plane. I can tell you this, it's not the passengers who need to be more \""""balanced.\"""" \n\nBut this sort of thing is typical with this airlines. It reminds me of public transportation, whereby standard operating procedure is run by-the-seat-of-their-pants. You get what you pay for with Spirit Airlines. So, to say the least, this latest experience of typical delays and lack of good judgment by this airlines left me with a sour taste in my mouth, the sound of the snap of the rubber glove, and the smell of a big box of week-old mackerel; and will likely be the last straw with me and this airlines, low prices or not, until they clean up their act. Let the flyer beware.",0
"Although the food is good and I am all about supporting a local business, I just can't deal with the smoke and spotty service. Even the dining area reeks of smoke. I had to take a shower after I got done eating there because the smell was just  too much. Also, our waitress who I assume is also the owner at first was attentive and then kinda forgot about us to go BS with the bar patrons and watch the game. Boyfriend's mom went without her ice tea refilled for a very long time. Server/owner also took forever to bring over the check. I could understand it if she was slammed, but not when I can see her standing at the bar watching the game. I gave this place a chance, but left with a completely different impression this time. Pass",0
I take both my dogs to the Durango Animal Hospital and they love Dr. McDermitt! He takes the time to answer all my questions (and trust me I have a lot) and has even taken the time to look over the ingredients on my dog food bag to make sure it was a good choice for my pups. I never feel like he rushes me and that's really important to me when I go to doctor's office. The doctors are all very nice and accommodating. Most of the receptionists are nice as well. Occasionally I'll run into one that's having a bad day or one that's rude but whatever.. the doctors are great!!,1
Ok.. the margharita's were petty decent and a good price..about $9 per but pretty stong. The food was mediocre at best. It appeared to be the usual corporate disconnect between their product and the customer. I had the fajitas.. they were kind of tough and sides were nothing to brag about. My wife had the fish tacos. They were OK at best. It is a place that is popular based on a song and the location is great as it is right across the street from the Ceasars Palace on the strip. I would say the if you are in Vegas there are much better places to eat;. Maybe a good stop for a drink but that is it..  Move on to better pastures.,0
"We went here for my brother's 40th birthday.  You know, when it comes to special occasions, places really let you down.  The food was ok, nothing special. And really pricey for what you got.  Server didn't know much about the food either.  Asked about a sauce being either smooth or chuncky, he said smooth.  Yeah, with chuncks in it!!!   Sat a long time between courses, also.  Like 45 minutes between entree and ONE dessert, for my brother for his birthday (that I had to pay for in advance, BTW).  Glasses and other dirty dishware sat on the table a REALLY long time as well.  All in all, we won't be going back there any time soon.  Too bad, too, it has a great view.",0
We are so happy we selected Matt Baker as our mortgage broker to close on our new home.  We loved the flat fee mortgage and that there were no surprises at closing.  Matt was even able to pull off a small miracle as we had to switch our loan at the last minute!  We would highly recommend Matt to any of our friends and family!  Thanks Matt!,1
"After being nickle and dimed about our trade-in to the point were we were about to walk out the door, our front tire goes flat the next day. After re-inflating it continues to lose air and we have to bring it to a garage due to being stranded. They showed us a defect in the tire where the side wall was bulging out the size of a golf ball. The garage mentioned that if we were on the highway we could have been killed as it would have been a total blowout. We then bring it to the Charlotte Volvo for repair and they send us a picture of another damage where someone had previously patched the tire. We then have the same sales manager for the next  2 months do the biggest finger pointing game we have ever seen. Calling and emailing that they are not responsible. Wow, 3 days after getting the car we had to have it towed and he is finger pointing. It shows what type of operation this is with no concern for our safety and the risk they put us in.",0
"Do not shop here!  Very rude staff, yelled at me to pass in other aisle. she must of been too lazy to stand up for 1.4 seconds. does not matter if items are only $1, staff has no respect for its customers. Avoid at all costs as majority of items are NOT $1! Other stores such as Target have Party supplies on sale for $1 and much much better quality!",0
I had a 7:30 reservation on a Monday night.  I did not get seated until 8:15.  At 9:00 no chef had come to cook for us. I had already complained to the manager once and he did nothing. Finally my family had to leave as we had hungry young children.  I am so disappointed and will never go here again.,0
"After reading all the good reviews, we were looking forward to eating here, but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell. Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go. Immediately, upon walking in the door, the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks. We did a 180 and walked right out. No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk. \n\nGet the smell worked out and we will give you another shot, Tasty Thai.",0
I ordered a vento box that everyone was so crazy about  and that was the most horrible food ever tasted  i even spend a day at  my hotelroom  since i got food poison for all of you out there make worth your money for the price i paid i would have gone to eat at panda express at least i know that they are not pretended  to call themselves something they are not  like volcano advertise false statements like  they say they sell teppanyaki food these people  need urgently take some classes before call themselves teppenyaki chefs they do not know that is that at all,0
"Too pricey when you have to cook your own meat - that was ok, but not great.   Selection a bit limited and noisy when busy.   Of course, I did not have the student price - so may be 3 stars if you can get it for $10.",0
"Mixed experiences here. Staff is mostly disinterested, but some are helpful. I would question some of their knowledge about skis and equipment. A guy named Justin seems the most knowledgeable of all. The last tune they did on my skis was so bad I had to take them to another shop near the ski resort to have de-tuned to make them ski-able again! On the positive side, great selection of stuff and prices seem quite reasonable.",0
Food was good but the service was bad. Waitress brought out my item but forgot to place the order for the other person with me. When she corrected her mistake the wrong item was brought out. Finally got the correct item but took it home. When we got the bill it was wrong. Got the one item free but the whole meal should of been free. First and last time. Too bad because the food was good.,0

"As a serious Hookah lover and a local, I frequent many of the hookah lounges here in the city. I have never walked into a hookah lounge and walked back out as quickly as I did. I didn't even check in! Walking into this hidden flop around 1:00 am, the first thing I noticed was the place looked very unkept and mundane. There were a scattered few people just sitting there and staring into oblivion, no conversations, no dancing, no lively entertainment., no fun. The most OUTRAGEOUS thing I couldn't help to block out was the overly obnoxious and extremely loud music that the \""""DJ\"""" was playing. In such a small place, there should never be music as loud as this was. This is not a concert venue, but a hookah lounge where there is supposed to be a relaxing mellow vibe. I couldn't even communicate with the waitress with what I wanted and she couldn't as well. My group and I started off at our table with a few waters and continuously struggled with the idea of actually staying here for a round of hookah. We were served Voss water without having the choice of tap. What if I didn't want to pay 12 dollars for a pretentious bottle of water? I didn't even want to experience the possible disappointment of a shisha sesh. The mood was so desolate and lifeless with horrible, ear-piercing \""""music,\"""" we had to leave, STAT! \n\nHookah has caught on to be a trendy aspect in the nightlife of Las Vegas over the past decade and I get the idea of said places trying to transcend the competitive idea of what a true hookah lounge is supposed to be. I don't know about you, but this is not what a hookah lounge should consist of. Personally, these lounges should forever be evolving, innovative but still remain true to this incredible Middle Eastern tradition. Luna is lost, if not dead. They have some major improvements if they ever want to see there business evolving positively. \n\nI've been past Luna many a time because of my insatiable hunger for the incredible tacos at Tacos El'gordo and I've always wondered what that eerie structure in the back was with an empty parking lot??   \n\nOh.....a place I will never go back to again.",0

"Raffles Caf\u00e9\nWe ended up eating at Raffles Caf\u00e9 after finding out the hard way that TheCafe at TheHotel was closed for the week that we would be staying there. That sucks for us! We walked from TheHotel through the casino at Mandalay Bay, and ended up at Raffles. It was around 12:30pm on the Monday of Thanksgiving week, and there was no line to be seated. My wife, 2 year old, and I sat down at the table where we were seated, and we decided to say a little prayer before we ordered. The waiter was nowhere in sight at this point, so we figured it wouldn't hurt. As we joined hands and started praying, our waiter interrupted us and, without an introduction, asked to take our drink orders. A little shocked in the moment, but not totally surprised due to the not-so-stellar Yelp reviews, we shook it off and ordered. \nThere was a sign out front for coconut pancakes with mango butter as a daily special, so my wife ordered that for my daughter, she ordered a grilled vegetable Panini, and I got a Greek salad. Bear in mind that the menu on their website is different from the menu we were given. It looks like Raffles or the web-design crew needs to pay more attention to detail.  \nAnyway, so after our negative first impression, the food comes out and we noticed that something was missing- well, something other than my daughter's silverware or drink, which is one of my pet peeves because it gives the feeling that my kid isn't counted as a person. The pancakes came out with regular butter, as my wife pointed out, and we started doubting ourselves that we read mango butter from the sign in the front. We asked the waiter the next time he came around, and he said that there was no mango butter today, but he could check in the back and see if there was any. Pet peeve #2 is when I, as a consumer, feel like a business is withholding the truth about a product that I'm purchasing. \nAnyway, we got a helping of mango butter after the waiter found some in the back, and I don't think we saw him after that. The manager came by and finished up our service. We finalized the check, which was about $44 after tax, and left. I felt displeased that the waiter left and didn't tell us. We were kind of wondering where he went, as we weren't checked up on for a bit. \nIt does stink that TheCafe is closed, because we would have loved to eat there instead. Maybe if we were into corn beef hash, we would give Raffles a fair chance. But, I think that we left there feeling a little sour about our experience. \n\nI've had better.",0
"I've been renting a property under Affordable Property Management for the past month, and I can't say I'm very happy at all. \""""Affordable\"""" and \""""Terrible\"""" are pretty much synonymous when it comes to this company. They always seem to need several reminders for every little question or concern. If the office wasn't 30 minutes away from my place, they'd probably see me every day...and not for a friendly cup of tea. The head honcho's office is crazy unorganized, so it doesn't surprise me that he never remembers to return correspondence. The receptionist is nice enough, but it seems she's given way too much responsibility and often has no clue what she's talking about. The condo I'm renting is very nice, but I honestly wish I was paying rent to a much more professional, knowledgable, responsive and organized company every month. =+(",0
"I've passed by this place quite a few times, but finally decided to dine in today. The service was very attentive, but I felt like they didn't go beyond what they teach you in table-waiting 101. Our server asked if we were ready for drinks, entrees, then desserts and let us know her personal favorites for each course, but didn't actually describe any of them. I honestly didn't have any problems with the service though, it's the food/prices that leave me less than satisfied. \n\nGuacamole ($15): Although it was pretty pricey, it was probably my favorite dish of the night. There were a lot of large chunks of avocado, which is something I could never complain about and it was very fresh and flavorful. The only thing that I didn't like was that the waitress asked if we were done with it once the chips ran out, even though we still had about a third of it left. It was just kind of annoying that she was trying to take the plate away, rather than offering us more chips.\n\nLarge pot of Jasmine Downy Pearls ($8.88) - Very aromatic and tasty. I would probably come here just for the tea.  \n\nChips and salsa ($4): I hardly touched the salsa, but I ate all the nice and crisp chips with the guacamole. Definitely worth the four bucks.\n\nPescado Frito ($6.50): Not very flavorful and not very \""""fried.\"""" If I'm going to pay $6.50 for ONE taco, I expect it to be pretty damn good. \n\nDancing Eggplant ($9.88) - The waitress seemed a little reluctant when we ordered this. She made sure to warn us there were bonito flakes on it and the eggplant was boiled. I had the feeling she didn't like that at all. We thought it was just okay.\n\nTraditional Sui Mai ($13.88): I really loved the crisp water chestnuts they added in the Sui Mai. The edible gold flakes on each piece also gave it a unique presentation. \n\nDon't Be Jealous (Hot and Sour Soup) $8.88: This was the most disgusting Hot and Sour soup I have every had. It seriously ruined my palette. The whole bowl of soup just reeked and tasted like hot red wine. I have NEVER tasted Hot and Sour soup like that before. I couldn't take more than two bites of it without feeling sick because of the strong wine flavor it had. Don doesn't even like Hot and Sour soup, but he could still taste how much worse it was than others. \n\nRou Jia Mo Street Sandwich ($8.88): Way too salty and saucy. And for a whopping $8.88, this was definitely not worth it. \n\nJericalla ($11) - Have you ever had Abuelita Hot Chocolate? It comes in a package like this: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/abuelita-mexican-hot-chocolate1.jpg containing tablets of compressed cocoa, sugar, and cinnamon: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cut-abuelita.jpg. Well, the small amount of custard on the bottom of the cup was covered in what seemed to be ground up tablets of Abuelita Hot Chocolate: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V1zh1nc2VASkoNUsyJS5JA/l.jpg and no, that was not a good thing. I felt like ai was just munching on hot chocolate powder. I mean, the custard and sorbet alone were good, but I couldn't eat those without eating all the powder. Plain and simple, it sucked. \n\nOverall, I loved the presentation of all the dishes, however the flavors just didn't match. The Hot and Sour soup really killed it for me. The only thing I think was worth coming here for was probably the tea, but that's still not something I would drive over here for.\n\nWarning: If you look at your bank statement a day or two after coming here and the amount charged is a lot higher than what you actually paid, it's because they like to \""""pre-authorize\"""" themselves for a 30% tip, but it goes down to whatever you actually paid them when the transaction clears. Why anyone would give this place a 30% tip is beyond me...",0
"There seems to be some kind of misconception, I believe, that British food is \""""bland,\"""" or otherwise lacking in flavor.  While that may be true in the UK, it certainly isn't the case, here.\n\nI don't get over to this place as much as I would like, and that's MY loss, because every time I dine here, I'm never disappointed.  In fact, a fraternal/social group to which I belong, used to meet here every Friday night, about 10+ years ago.  We had most of the upstairs section to ourselves.\n\nI can recommend almost everything on the menu, as at one time or another, I've sampled most of the fare offered.  I treated a total of 5 of my good friends there on June 13, 2012, and the total price for all 6 of us was under $100, so their charges are certainly reasonable.\n\nBut best of all, if I may be permtted a totally MALE observation, I definitely noticed the delightfully (and incredibly) SHORT Scottish kilts being worn by the female servers.\n\nNo joking guys, they all have LEGS TO DIE FOR.",1
"If you're looking for good authentic mexican food, Carolina's is the place to be. I recommend going during the day since it's not in the best part of town. I ordered a chimichanga, that was the perfect amount of crispiness and loaded with shredded beef and cheese. It was topped with a generous amount of guacamole & sour cream with refried beans and bland rice on the side. You really can't beat the prices here.\nThe reason I'm giving it two stars is mostly due to the fact that it's a complete hole in the wall, heck, I wouldn't be surprised if there were actual holes in the walls.",0
"Went here for a girlfriends birthday on Saturday with a large group.  Need to preface this with that statement because it is difficult to get a large group all on the same page.  Some of the group was more interested in the football game in the bar, people having conversations etc.  Our waiter came by initially to take drink orders and let us know that he would be taking care of our table.  When he came back to the table we let him know that they could break down our table because two people were not going to show up.  He displayed visible irritation.  There must have been some kind of confusion because the waiter must have been waiting for the rest of our group to return from watching the football game at the bar before taking our appetizer or dinner order.  We could see that he was getting very irritated with our table so we ordered about 4 or 5 appetizers and more drinks.  And I do recall telling him that the people at the bar will probably not come back till the game is over.  My girlfriend then said to the waiter that we were very sorry and to please not be irritated with us because we had been there a hour and not ordered dinner yet.   He looked at her and said in a very nasty voice that this was how he made his money.... \nWe were stunned that he said that to us.  There was a dead silence at our table.  We were aware of what was going on with our table and would have treated him very well.  Once he said that I had no interest in increasing our tab for his benefit.  I was already full from all the appetizers so I decided not to order a entree and neither did the rest of the table.  \nI have been here before and have had a enjoyable time... I don't know if the waiter was having a bad day or what.  Not acceptable customer service!",0

"It was my fourth trip to the Mini Barbershop.\nI was greeted by the usual guy who thinks its okay to speak on his cell phone and greet a customer at the same time.  Let me say that the reason I have been going there is because Chris has done a fantastic job and I have the easiest hair (lack of) to cut.  I go there because he somehow makes it worth while.  Today he was not there and I asked for the 20.00 haircut, never offered a drink or beer... Was greeted by a girl who was about as enthusiastic about her job as a suicide bomber.  I ended up with a 7 minute haircut.  Its not even good.  After a very nice gentleman at the checkout counter realized how unhappy I was he offered to pay for my next haircut and also offered to shave my neck which is why I like going there but I felt very uncomfortable with being passed from person to person so I paid and left.  Oh and since I have been in customer service my whole entire life... don't ask a customer out loud how much they want to tip their barber... seriously its like a kiosk checkout system at a crappy mall.",0
"Not so much.  I should have known...\n\nThat pretty much sums up my experience with this office.  My disclaimer is that my issues are with the staff and not the actual doctor.  He was fine, but nothing to write home about.  (Side note: he kind of reminds me of Alfred Molina.)  Anyway, back to the staff...\n\nI had a sore throat for days and regardless of my valiant efforts to drown myself with tea, water, and throat drops, it was getting worse.  I called in sick to work on Wednesday and went on a mission to find a new doctor near my house since the last one was only so-so and doesn't work at the office in my neighborhood which she used to.  I found this office and when I talked to the receptionist I should have known it was going to be bad, but it's crazy hard to get a same-day new patient appointment.  I was able to get a 1045 appointment when I called shortly after 9.  Sounds promising.\n\nThey get a lot of my information off of the phone call and didn't tell me to come in early to complete paperwork, so I arrive at 1040.  I sign in and get handed the good ol' clipboard of forms.  I should have known...  I fill them out spastically so I am not holding up the appointments and can get on to the wellness I need.  Then I wait.  And wait.  And wait.  My only saving grace at this point is the fact they are showing \""""What About Bob?\"""" on the TV and it serves as a mild distraction from my growing angst.  Then I wait a little more.  And then some more.  \n\nFinally (AT 1140!!!) I get taken to a room by a semi-unfriendly nurse.  She takes my blood pressure about 5 times before she can get it - I don't know what she's doing and am not convinced she does either.   She finishes all the other prep measurements and says the doctor will be in soon.  So I wait.  And wait.  And wait.  At this point I wish I brought in a magazine or something.  Then I wait more.  Then I manage to find some magazines tucked away, but am now too tired, mad, and lazy to get one.  So I wait.  And wait.\n\nFinally (AT 1215!!!) the doctor comes in.  He goes through a bunch of non-noteworthy questioning and examining.  He takes a throat culture and then tells me he thinks it's either viral or Strep.  He says the results of the throat culture will be in on Friday (two days from the visit) and they will call me with the results.  He gave me some antibiotics to start just in case it is Strep and sent me on my way.  \n\nI think the hour and a half wait was beyond ridiculous.  Especially for the 10 minute appointment.  Couldn't one of them just say they were running late when I got there??  I think that's just a common courtesy and I would have been less irritated if they would have told me that up front.  Bitches.  Ugh, I've had about enough of them already.\n\nFast forward two days.  I am anxiously awaiting the test results so I know what I've got and whether I still need to take the meds or not.  I haven't heard from them by 230, so I give them a ring.  I nicely say I was in on Wednesday and was told my throat culture results would be in on Friday, I hadn't heard back, and I wanted to check if it was in.  I was told (imagine irritated put-off voice with unnecessary attitude) no, it wasn't in and if it was, they would call me and let me know.  Grr.  I asked if she thought it would be in today.  She told me (remember the voice and attitude) no, and even if it did, the doctor would have to look at it first and he was gone for the day.  When they do get it in, they will call me.  Double Grr.  Not a shred of customer service in the whole building (except for What About Bob).\n\nStay as far away from this place as possible.  The staff is SO awful that I'm sure you would be more satisfied with a lesser doctor with better staff.  They are just as important in the doctor visit experience.  I will not be going back here ever and as much as I hate trying to find a new doctor again, I welcome that struggle compared to this angry house of medicine.  I should have known...",0
"I rarely leave negative reviews.. but this is consistently the worst service out of any Starbucks I've been to - EVER. Unfortunately I go here because it is close to my house and I love starbucks iced coffee... But almost ALL the employees are always completely out of it, slow, not eager to help, and constantly make mistakes because thy aren't listening/don't care. It's so weird - I actually really think Starbucks manager and corporate staff would not be happy. Normally I love starbucks but this is more like an overstaffed-yet-super-slow store pretending to be starbucks. It's not fast or efficient like the brand is known for. It's like everyone hired here are high school dropouts with no desire to do anything. It's bad service EVERYTIME and the drive thru line is always really slow because the chick they always have it makes so many mistakes. Also- they never have the creamer out on the weekend mornings and it's like pulling teeth trying to get their attention to ask for it. All I get is a black iced coffee, and it ALWAYS takes at LEAST 10 minutes.... on the weekends after 10am. Not their busiest time. The line is just long because all the workers are alway so confused.",0
"I love the General store for breakfast.  I love the comfy cozy atmosphere, the friendly service, the generous portions, and the consistently good food.\n\nMy son's regular standby is the Mickey pancake with sausage.  It's a HUGE pancake for a little dude, so I usually polish off 1/3 of it.  It's fluffy pancake goodness.  And the warm syrup.  Yum.\n\nMy regular standby is the veggie omelet.  It's just a simple, well-done omelet.  Nothing crazy, just some down home yumminess.  I've also had the corned beef hash and eggs.  That's some food coma material right there.\n\nWe usually go when it's not too busy.  I've heard it can get crowded.  No matter what time we go, we always have breakfast.  I love breakfast.  I've never had lunch there.  I keep telling myself I'll try lunch next time, but next time comes and my veggie omelet calls.",1
"Let me start by saying the coffee is great! The donuts at this location suck though. Usually dry and just bad. I live down the street and have tried this location 30 + times and I can honestly say they have a terrible product. I mean come on, donuts is what you guys do and you are not doing it very well. If you want to taste a real doughnut so you know what you should be making go stop by Bosa or even a Bashas. Service is always good and the coffee is great but the name is not Dunkin Coffee...get it together people.",0
"These ignorant people have no concept of city property or the right to a clear sidewalk. They are incapable of staying inside their assigned patio space, and instead grab land at a bus stop to place tables and block our freedom of movement. Right after this joint opened up, a bus bench mysteriously became unbolted and teleported to an inconvenient location, allowing this joint to place more tables outside. It makes sense, there is no air conditioning or even a mister system for the patio. Who wants to eat lousy pizza in 110-degree heat? Just kidding, I never tasted their pizza and sometimes it gets down to 88 degrees here. But these adult babies will have a big problem with the City of Tempe if they continue to treat public property like it was their very own sandbox.",0
"This is my 2nd time here.  I was hoping to get the lady i had last time but she was not there.  \n\nI requested an 1 hour foot massage which was $39.00. (Yes! I love foot massages.) So the lady r escort me to the room and laid me on table and put my foot in hot water.  I laid there for about 2 minutes while she was outside of room. \n\nShe started with some type of scrub which felt good when she rubbed up and down legs to feet.  Now, its time for massage.  It seemed as she was using her knuckles and it was painful. Before completing she said you can get back, neck for 30 minutes for for $30.00. I didn't say yes. She just automatically stopped doing goot massage at 30 minutes and mentioned again. Man, I was like maybe the back will be done better than this awful foot massage.  Needless to say she didnt have a pattern for back massaging. It seemed  like she will do this part and then this part for seconds and the other side of body a different way. I can say she did stretch my body good. The total was $49.00  and I gave her $60.00 and she said thank you, not even reaching for any change. She was standing there waiting for me to leave. I got confused on the total for a minute.  This lady thought she was getting an $11.00 tip.  I think not lady bring me $5 00.",0

"We were in town on a business trip, and had the weekend to ourselves.  We took the train into Charlotte and walked around town looking for good places to eat.  Stumbled across BlackFinn and what a fantastic surprise! The bar was packed for the Panthers game, but we had no trouble getting a seat.  We shared Ying-Yang shirmp, which was half pound of crispy shrimp tossed in a sweet spicy asian sauce, garnished with sriracha on the side.  Wow, was this amazing! The MARGHERITA flat bread pizza had tomatoes, garlic butter, fresh mozzarella and basil and was absolutely delicious.  And words can not describe how wonderful the BLACKENED BRIE was, served warm with ciabatta toast,\nsliced apples and apricot cranberry chutney.  The bartender even brought us extra toast at no charge.  Our mission was to visit as many places as possible, and I wish now we had eaten a meal here, or come back again later in the week.  We visited 35 restaurants and bars in 12 days, and BlackFinn was in the top 3.",1
"This was my 1st trip here as I work close by and wanted to try this place out for a while. Finally called in a to go order, and the staff was friendly on phone and mentioned food would be ready in 5 min! Wow, I rushed right over (3 min) and they were just finishing up. I spoke to the owner about origins of seattle's best, and also got a recommendation on the cod and chips. My fish and chips was ready and it totalled 8.95. I got a small sample of clam chowder also just to try it out. Well the fish was surprisingly good. It had a light flakey batter without to heavy of oil saturation, and the fish itself was hot, steaming, and the flavor was subtle and fresh. I broke it easily into chunks and used up two tarters(handmade and excellent, ask for 2, you'll need them!) There was an entire half fillet of fish, but it dissapeared quickly. The clam chowder came with a large bag of long island style oyster crackers and the chowder itself was light, fluffy, flavorful with a kick of spice and clam. Also they wrapped the to go bowl in tinfoil to prevent spillage. The slaw was really good. It had a small vinager bite, but was smooth and light. Crunchy and fresh slaw topped the whole thing off. I finished off the fries with some of the marinara that came with the fish. The fries were perfectly cooked, but how could you mess up fries right? Next time ill be back for the cod, and clam chowder. Great experience, and no i don't work for them or know them, or was i paid to write this. Just wanted others to find a cool place in a little corner. Bring them some business, so we can enjoy it for years to come. Thanks for reading.",1
"Tiny sandwiches at normal prices after a long wait.\n\nIf you find yourself at Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile and need a cheap bite, this is not a terrible stop.  But there is absolutely no reason to make the Earl of Sandwich your mealtime destination.\n\nThe sandwiches are palatable, yet unremarkable, but what's most-prominent is that they are a half-sized sandwich.  That explains the pricing; double each cost to compare apples to apples.",0
Worst thing about this place is it ruined all other pulled pork sandwiches for me!  That thing is fantastic!  Atmosphere is fun.  Staff is great.   Stop reading and just go,1
Nothing especial about the food here.  Just a regular tasting Mexican restaurant.   Rice and beans taste like Robertos and food has same flavor.,0

"eh. I've been here twice. TOTALLY OVERRATED. Like, SOOOOOOOO OVERRATED. If you are 21 and asian (hey, i'm not discriminating, I'm just calling it how it is, BOTH times I was there, that's what I saw) then you may like it. \nI'm from L.A. and I don't go clubbing all the time, but I have been had my share of exclusive/hot/trendy clubs and this one def has the potential but there is WAYYY too much going on. The staff, the 4 flights of stairs, not any stairs, like metal stairs that crunch your feet and toes if you wear heels  (i'm not joking. and girls, wear COMFORTABLE SHOES) The $16 or $17 dollar cocktails (but they don't make them weak, they have a heavy pour) and not being able to sit anywhere, and being sandwhiched between people constantly becuase it is soo packed is not fun for me or my friends. Again, I've been here twice and it as exactly the same both times. Asian people, no seats unless you have a table, and tons of people that isn't for someone that is clausterphobic. \nIt's not fun. You just stand around and watch people. If you want to dance, you have about 3 centimeters of space. It's not worth it. Well, maybe for the view of the pool. That was the only perk to this club.",0
"The food is edible, but that's about it. The prices are also typical for the strip, $15 for an omelet or scramble  at breakfast.",0
"Not my cup of tea. \n\nI went in with some friends for an early dinner. The place wasn't too busy when we arrived and it's seat yourself so we grabbed a table and sat down. Our waitress was super friendly but the food just didn't do it or me. \n\nI'm not an ice tea drinker (I know...I know) so I can't comment on that but here goes:\n\nFor our appetizer we ordered the deviled eggs which come topped with chicken and bacon. How could you mess that up??? Well, the presentation was just bad. It looked like they just threw the eggs and toppings on the plate. To make matters worse, the flavors just were not good. It was like the chicken came out a can...ugh! No thank you.\n\nFor my meal, I ordered the chicken and waffles. I knew based on previous reviews, to ask for my syrup on the side...to avoid syrupy chicken. But let's just say, again that the textures and flavors were a huge miss. I expected the waffle to be light and fluffy...nope. Instead it was dry and crumbled with each bite. That's not a good thing...the saving grace was the tabasco butter. Now, that was yummy.\n\nThe chicken was not crispy and I wasn't a fan of the skin...See I am not one of those girls that takes the skin off and only eats the chicken meat...Nooooo....normally I eat it all. But not here...the skin nor the chicken were good for me. \n\nSo pretty much Sweet Tea's just wasn't for me.",0
"It was worth it for the groupon, I guess, but I won't be going back.  The place is small, the service was horrific, and the food was assembly lined together and wasn't even piping hot even tho it took forever to come out, the ingredients were minimal even tho they charged $1 for each add on, and the flavor wasn't anything impressive!  The place up on Warm Springs is a 5 star joint compared to this place.",0
This place was AMAZING!!! Went with 4 friends and did the Omakase for 2 and then added some other dishes we wanted. The meat candy is a must have. We missed the happy hour which I'm sure is impressive as well. The inside is well decorated and updated. Great service and great plate presentation.,1
"I have driven by Rusty's several times and always wondered what the food was like- now I know. I read the reviews on Yelp like I always do and they were mixed. But I figured why not maybe they ordered the wrong thing. Plus, I wanted something different from my usual Subway. Anyway first off thee decor is a bit off putting because its like the house of mirrors. Some of the other reviewers said this was a Charlotte institution, but I haven't been here long enough to know that. I just know they need to change the inside because it's a bit creepy. So, I ordered the chicken cheesesteak, fries and some coleslaw. This is not authentic if that is what you are looking for. the cheesesteak was soggy. I got mushrooms which were runny. What was more disappointing was that the chicken was like steakums and it was one layer of chicken on top of a glob of mayo, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms. Basically there was no chicken plus it tasted like shoe leather. The fries were ok. Not as crispy as others stated and they needed SALT! I didn't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross.  The coleslaw was full of mayo, so I didn't eat all of that either.  The pickle was good even though it was really salty, but I like pickles so I'm bias. I can say I probably won't go there again and I should have just gone to Subway. Take it or leave it.",0
"We tried this place in January. Make sure you take a reservation and you may have to plan weeks ahead. The Double Down Foie Gras is a must but beware of heart attackss! The Petite Truite du Quebec had an interesting presentation, how it was wrapped with its skin, taste was ok. The Lobster Spaghetti was a huge disapointment and way overpriced. Though it was not lobster season so that may excuse the poor meat texture but the pasta did not seem home made at all. We were charged for the bread. In summary I would say overpriced due to the hype and you can find much better restaurants at this budget.",0
"The 4 stars is for this particular Subway.  Most have subpar service and questionable hygeine, but I was famished on the drive home last night, debated on a flatbread at dunkin donuts but i have those too often....and saw this Subway so I pulled in for a grilled chicken sandwich.  \n\nI walked in to a full house, but both employees behind the counter gave big smiles and eye contact and acted like they not only cared about their jobs, but about making good sandwiches and being nice to their customers.  Big thumbs up for service!  These two won my heart over....I hope they stick around.",1
"I am on the road for work more days out of the year than I am at home. I am a member of nearly every major hotel chain's reward program and consistently stay at hotels ranging from the average 3 star hotel to exclusive beachside resorts. \n\nDespite my hotel experience, I must say, the staff at this particular Hampton Inn blew every other hotel's staff out of the water. The front desk employees and lobby hosts were extremely courteous and really wanted to make sure we enjoyed our stay. In fact, they seemed to go out of their way to do things like open doors for guests and help guests carry bags to their cars. I've never had anyone actually clear my table for me while eating a complimentary breakfast in a hotel lobby.\n\nShout out to Janaan, who was an absolute sweetheart. It was such a pleasure to see her smiling face welcome us nearly every time we walked in the front doors.\n\nWhile this Hampton Inn's atmosphere and cleanliness was consistent with every other Hampton Inn I've stayed at, my 5-star rating is based solely on the excellent customer service.",1
"Want diner food with friendly staff and fun people watching? Waffle House is where it's at! Yes, the food is typical diner food - i.e. a little grease, a little butter, a lot o' calories and tasty!  Just plan a day of walking around or heading on over to the gym and you'll be golden.  \n\nThere was a bit of a wait to get seated here, but they had a list and moved through cleaning up tables and getting people seated in a quick and efficient manner. Once it was our turn we were seated at the counter where our waitress, Mama Jude (highly doubt that's her real name, but it doesn't really matter does it?), was amazingly friendly, joked around with us and made sure we were well cared for from start to finish. \n\nWe both had the All Star platter.  I opted for cheese in my grits, a chocolate chip waffle, eggs over easy and sausage patties.  He opted for cheese in his grits and eggs, a plain waffle, scrambled eggs and ham. Everything was cooked exactly as ordered and tasted great.  Yes, we walked around the rest of the day to work it off, but it was worth it!\n\nOverall: A\nWalk in knowing that you are getting diner food made on a grill and you'll be good to go!  Ask for Mama Jude!",1

"I actually read all of the wonderful reviews for this one and decide to go in. \n\nI went ahead and made appointment for my car on my day off 3 days in advance online. Seemed pretty easy. Went in 15 minutes early from my appointment, got checked in. Wasn't given a time estimate for they would be done but since I had appointment I figured it wasn't going to be very long. Boy, I was wrong. 1 1/2 hours later my car hasn't moved. Went up to the front to ask what was going on, they said they had a few cars in front of me. I asked \""""Well I made a appointment online, does that count worth anything?\"""" He replied \""""No, not really. You still have a hour wait time.\"""" Towards the end of this forever wait time this brunette young girl, came in and stated that she has something wrong with her car. Another employee went ahead and stated \""""Sure go ahead and bring your car around back, I can look at it right now.\""""  My car still hasn't moved from the front of the store. I was so upset, I just left. \n\nBest part of all, when they had to go and look at few things in the car to get the paperwork started, the guy couldn't even figure out how to open the hood of the car.  I ended up having to go outside and show them.  Made me feel very uneasy. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone under any circumstances.",0

"I wanted to like this place since I was 3 out 3 from Yelp recommendation. With four hours into dinner I was responsible to find a place for nine of us. They were nice enough to take our reservation. I ordered fish and chips. Sorry it wasn't that good. I remembered way back when my friend asked if my tongue gets spoiled from eating all the good food. I said no because I still enjoy Del Taco and Wendy's. It's not all together true. I'm sure it's not just me but when you tried something so good that becomes your bench mark. You wish you can find something this good and hopefully doesn't cost you an arm and a leg. The best fish and chips I was at Venetian. Fries are so perfected by your McDonalds and Wendy's that it's harder for mom and pop restaurant to follow suit. \n\nTheir chips were fries and they were soft same goes with their fried fish. The fish itself is not flavorful, sigh I wanted to like it so much since I love fish and chips.\n\nFor appetizer we ordered chicken wings and it were good only 8 pieces per plate though.\n\nWe waited almost 40 mins for our food. The waitress was nice and patient even though I was not. She keep asking, \""""are there anything else I can get you?\"""" and I tell her, \""""yes, we like our food\"""" I was feeling a bit a pressure since I'm the one bringing all my friends here and I wanted us to be served and fed properly.\n\nI tried my buddy steak and it was cooked well, medium, pink, soft, and flavorful. Again it was served with cold, mushy fries. They also serve prime ribs didn't get to try that one but it must have been good since my friend cleaned it up\n\nI like the ambiance if that's how Irish pubs are in Irish I'm cool with it. Love the live band playing Irish tune. I like how restaurant stay true to their culture and identity. \n\nPro:\nAmbiance\nFriendly waitress\nRuben sandwich was good a little much on butter but the meat was done well. Do order the ruben sandwich over fish and chips\n\nCon:\nFood takes  too long to get to our table\nMy fish and fries were not crunchy and fish has little flavor like it was thawed last night. With any seafood items it's best if it's caught in the morning and serve right away. Anything frozen or serve over a day old the freshness is compromised.",0
Oh Riccio's how I adore thee!  If you are looking for some good Italian fare then you should try this place out.  I've never gotten anything in here that was bad and most of the entrees are wonderful.\n\nIt's worth a trip there for the complimentary garlic knots alone...yum!!  I give them a solid 4 stars because while the food is great it's not really 5 stars great.  Also the atmosphere in the restaurant isn't the best in the world but considering it's in an older strip mall they are doing pretty good.\n\nI haven't tried the pizza before but they seem to sell a lot of them and the wait staff and owners are always super friendly.,1

I was interested in the members only section of the club, but did not inquire - perhaps on my next visit!",1

"I've never eaten at Hardee's.\n\nI've been to Hardee's twice. Once was waaay back in 2008 or so, when I went in and ordered some chicken tenders. They told me they were out of chicken tenders (?) so I'd have to order something else. Pass. I've been avoiding it ever since.\n\nYesterday, boyfriend and friends wanted Hardee's. I figured it was time to let bygones be bygones, so I went to Hardee's and ordered the three-chicken-tender combo basket with curly fries and a drink. The girl behind the counter was efficient but rushed, which is kind of what I expect from fast food employees, so I'm not really fazed by that. My friends were already seated and served, so I filled my beverage and sat with them. I made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table, as directed.\n\nBoyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as I sit down. This is normal.\n\nFriend A finishes his burger about five minutes later. Still no sign of my food.\n\nFriend B finishes her meal. By now it's been ten minutes. Hmm.\n\nI notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have FINISHED at this point.\n\nI check my receipt. It's been fifteen minutes. My friends need to get back to work. I flag down the next passing employee, who happens to be the manager. I ask him what had happened to my food. Manager disappears, comes back three or so minutes later. Apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer (??) and they burned, so rest assured, they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so.\n\nNo.\n\nI tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund. He was sincere and apologetic, which I appreciate, but at this point I had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food. I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. \""""Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!\"""" I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil. It's clean, friendly, and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome. I even make substitutions and deletions to my order, and they have NEVER gotten it wrong. So, the moral of this story, in short - save your time and money by skipping Hardee's and go next door to Taco Bell.",0
"I feel bad about doing this (most of my reviews are 5 stars), but we ordered several viands from DJ's & all of them were grease factories with a bit of food in them. I don't remember flavor. I remember grease. There was so much grease on my lips I didn't need to put on lip gloss. Srsly I've tasted much better food in the Philippines - from  places that charge like $3 per meal.\n\nIt's 'Filipino' to treat your friends/fam when they're in town, to drive them around, take them somewhere nice for a meal. DJ's is most probably where you would take them - if you secretly kind of hate them, for whatever reason (maybe they 'forgot' to reimburse you that $400, or they're spreading rumors about your spouse, or something).\n\nTo homesick kabayans, don't waste your $ if you're looking for flavor or quality, or anything decent. You're better off eating Asian food from elsewhere & watching Wowowee at home.",0

"Exciting news people! For years Wendy's has been serving bland tasteless dry burgers and horrible fries. My husband has a certain fondness for them, but he had always been forced to eat at Wendy's without me because I couldn't tolerate crappy fast food. \n\nThis all changed recently when Las Vegas became THE test market for the entire country for Dave's new Hot and Juicy burger and natural cut fries with sea salt. Yup, in many parts of the country they still are serving those dry tasteless burgers but not here my friends....\n\nThe new burger is the real deal. It IS hot and juicy and really great for a fast food burger. I don't get why it's so juicy and moist, but it is somehow. They also have nice new fresh veggies (apparently crinkle cut pickles are a big deal? and red onions?) and a new improved bun with BUTTER ON IT. Oh hell yes. If I'm eating 50 grams of fat damnit give me a couple more. The fries are much improved as well ! \n\nIf you must slum it at Wendy's for whatever reason, have no fear, the food is finally decent !",1

I saw an ad for a used Volkswagen they were selling and inquired about it. I hadn't  made my decision yet and Ashlee followed up a week later and we talked about it over the phone and agreed to an amazing deal. I went to test drive and bought it right away! Easiest car buying experience ever!!! Thanks!!,1
"Meh I was under wooed. I lived in Vegas for nearly 2 years, was probably there 30 times before I made the move, and have been back twice since I've moved. I know a thing or two about a thing or two and this hotel didn't really do it for me. \n\nThe Good: \n-Room itself was fine, the shower and tub were pretty awesome, view was pretty good.\n-Rate they offered me was very reasonable, cheaper than some of the other hotels\n-Staff at the Casino bar by the elevators to get to you're room. Same guys were working all weekend long. Awesome group of guys made hanging out there fun, you should commend them.\n--Great dinner spots here, not really much for breakfast or lunch, but dinner they are covered on\n\nThe Bad:\n--There's no place to get food by the pool. I mean they have a menu but it's extremely limited and you have to go inside to find something decent. PS- the casino is like 10 degrees below zero. So when you are partially wet outside by the pool and it's 115 outside, your implants basically freeze and you become a Popsicle this is not the look you are going for...trust me.\n--It took us almost 30 mins to check into our room. Now granted it was ready, and it was like 1 pm, we actually walked by the line earlier say around 12 but the line was really long then too. So, we went and had lunch then came back and indeed it was slightly shorter, but not really. \n--Loosing, loosing money is bad we all lost money. #boo\n\nThe Ugly: \n--Coffee-I need it, I want it, I got to have it. There are only 2 places to get coffee here, you MUST go downstairs, and both are going to have lines that are at least 15 mins (no joke 20 people deep).  I can barely walk w/out coffee in the morning and I also hate lines. I also was too late to do room service b/c I'm out having fun \n--Couldn't get a late checkout, had a knock at the door at 11 am to make sure we were checking out, I hate this. I was offered a rate of $49 if I wanted to extend the room to 6 pm. My flight was at 420, Just needed the room to like 2 pm. Got a big no go on that one. Had to then go check my bags w/ the bellmen, go to another casino for lunch, come back and then head to the airport. They made this alot more difficult then it really needed to be. And lost me to another casino. \n--Table minimums are freaking STEEP here!  It's 4th of July weekend, I get it, but $100 mins at 7 pm for Black Jack?  The other mins were $200 and $300.  We had to go to another casino to gamble...now does that make sense at all to you?  The tables were not busy at all. Not surprising.\n\n\nWOULD I STAY HERE AGAIN- No-unless they gave me free rooms or something, but this would be a NO for me. Would I go here again, YES but not actively.",0
"Absolutely the best fish and zucchini I've had in Vegas! OK...only fish and zucchini I've had, ever - but it was good enough that I can safely assume it would be the best.\n\nPortions are gigantic. Come ready to share.\n\nService...meh. He didn't seem to know what he was doing at the register. Forgot my iced coffee, and took him several trips to get everything to me. He was very apologetic about forgetting my large, iced mocha and offered me a free refill. While it was a good move customer-satisfaction wise, it wired me for the rest of the night. Whhhheeeee!",1
"You might walk in, but there is a fair chance you will waddle out.  Full disclosure; I went to Terra because a wonderful friend of mine had a gift card.  However, I would go again and pay every cent of the rather high prices.  We could possibly attribute this to my goldfish memory, but this is the best restaurant I have been to in Charlotte.\n\nLet's start with the atmosphere   The place is small and very unassuming from the outside, being tucked in next to a Starbucks in what just seems like a strange place for such a nice restaurant.  Or the perfect place for the best kept culinary secret in Charlotte.  The decor inside is simple, clean, understated and elegant.  Lots of nicely finished wood and white tablecloths galore.  Make sure that you keep an eye out for the gaudily framed picture of a steak, though.  Altogether the atmosphere is unassuming but pleasant, with some subtle touches that I really like.  Let's attribute my mixed feelings about it to my lack of culture.\n\nAnyway, the food.  Wow, the food.  We ordered duck pate, the meat and cheese plate, lamb sausage with cous cous, and the richest ravioli this side of the pearly gates.  It was all amazing.  I could rank them from best to worst, but that would be silly.  The \""""worst\"""" is easily on par with anything else I have had in Charlotte (and I make full use of restaurant week).  Everything-the plating, the timing, the flavors.\n\nI almost forgot, don't forget your glass of wine.  I am no connoisseur but the selection of wine and mixed drinks was fine, if a little steeply priced.  Our server had a personality straight out of Office Space, but did a great job so I shouldn't be mean.\n\nI guess my point is, eat here. You won't be disappointed.  Have I ever steered you wrong? What? You don't even know me? Whatever, just trust me.  Do it.  Shoo! Go make a reservation!",1
"Good hotel.  Great distance from the hotel our convention was at, and near the strip.  Didn't like the $12 a day resort fee, but what can you do?  And the iPod plug in on our phone didn't work.",1
"I am very unhappy with the service received today at your store.  An african american female representative was very rude and chatting on cell phone.  I asked about regular caramel apples and she stated they were unavailable.  I was trying to utilize a living social voucher purchase.  I then proceeded to purchase several other items.  My total came to $19.50 for $20 to spend.  The representative stated that I had to spend $20.  Therefore, I requested to forego the $.50 since the product I came for to was unavailable.  The representative stated the policy requires that I spend $20 even if your company does not have the product that the voucher calls for!  This is a idiotic policy and the manager was unavailable to be contacted.  The purpose of the voucher is to bring in customers and purchase items.  Now, I will no longer support your business because of the behavior exhibited by customer service.  I will also notify others of my experience.  I have been to your company many times and never had anything remotely like this before.",0
"Back in the mid-Nineties, studio-apartment-dwelling, student-loan-burdened me would come here and get great deals on things like Ecco shoes, Kenneth Cole shirts, fashionable jeans, and other things I never could have afforded new from Nordstrom's. Sometimes the condition was questionable, but the price always reflected that. I wore out several pairs of high-line shoes purchased here for $11-$12. \n\nThose days are long gone. Now, can't find a pair of shoes here for less than $30. The clothes are picked over. And mainly, going there is an opportunity for me to  bump into the future ex-Mrs. Bill B., or perhaps the exit strategy from the current prospective Mrs. Bill B. \n\nBecause If you're looking for young or not-quite-so-young-anymore shoppers in 5-inch heels, miniskirts and too much make-up, this is a great place to find them.\n\nJust don't offer to buy them shoes. Anymore. These days.",0
Just found this little gem while stopping to check messages on way to somewhere else. Great little shop.  Andrea Was wonderful. Can't wait to eat my purchases and come back again with a gift from my shop.  Us small businesses have to look out for each other,1
"Las Vegas strip offers the best cuisines of the world... WRONG!!!!!\nBecause it's the best, it has to be very expensive.... CORRECT.\n\nTodai is definitely the exception to the first... for $35 a person... in Nov 2009.\n\nI love sashimi... it tasted old here. The variety of sushi and Maki was minimal. It's not the same Todai I remember from various cities such as Plano TX, Portland OR, Pleasant Hill CA, or Orange CA. Todai destroyed the only Sashimi buffet in Phoenix... like Wal-mart... conquered and gone.\n\nThinking about it still leaves me a bad taste as of today. My thought of Todai has gone down tremendously after another try in Chicago lately (see review). Luckily there are many competitors springing up in southern California and various cities.\n\nDiner beware. You will enjoy stale fish here... you may not get diarrhea.",0
"We hear about the buffet at Bellagio so I made decision to try it even my husband and I don't like to eat buffet. We spent almost $90 for both for brunch today Christmas Day. The food not good, the sushi area only 3 kinds, the shrimp cocktail does not fresh, dry ham, Chinese  food only 3 different kind, dessert okay but the cheese cake salty . Will never come back again, we rather go to the restaurant over at The Venetian the best service and the foods is excellent , grand Lux Cafe is the bomb. Bellagio please improve your buffet to get better and worth it for the $ people pay you. the hotel is beautiful but the buffet is really bad.",0
"No, I don't want to take the bus to get to the train. \n\nIn my opinion, they didn't go far enough for people who live in Phoenix. It may be a good solution for Tempe and Mesa residents commuting to Phoenix, but it isn't effective for Phoenicians who want to get from the north valley into CenPho.",0
Better than ever... Amazing Italian food at an affordable price. Wouldn't go anywhere else.  Thank God JC is back!,1
"Drove my car in from Florida and it is a MESS. I think we killed every single bug between Florida and Scottsdale. (you're wecome)\nAnywho, I walked in to check out all of their services and they have all sorts of price ranges from simple to extraordinary. My husband is my car-cleaning snob, so I stuck with the basics and let him go back to get a demo of their services.\nYes, you read correctly - a demonstration.\n\nI pulled up to the line and chose their $27.xx service, which is everything including vacuum and tires and air freshener (asked them to hold off on the air freshener, because I usually can't stand the stuff - I have to stick to my Scentsy smells). He promised me that they'd get off the bugs at whatever price point, but I picked the highest one because they deserved the money.... it was that bad.\n\nThe car came out fabulous - I'd forgotten it was white. Didn't see any bug remains on the front end and the vacuum job was pretty good (I still see the Bugle between the center console and passenger seat, but that bugger is really stuck in there).\n\nWith the $27.xx car wash (sorry I forgot their name for it) I can get another wash within 7 days (not the same services, but at least it will keep the car white for a little longer).\n\nI'll be back, for sure. It's convenient and quick and good service!",1
"awful, place is dirty, all chairs have stains all over them.  Place is not clean, soda machines only have PEPSI products and the tea is not freshly brewed tea at all, it is machine taste,  Kitchen is dirty and they do not wear gloves when preparing food.\nFood is awful.",0
"RnR I tried to like you, I really did.  I've lived in Scottsdale for a few years now so I am used to the restaurant/night club/trendy spot but I just couldn't get into RnR.  I've been there for dinner several times and didn't enjoy myself.  The place is loud, the food mediocre and the service ranges from good to plain awful.  Nothing on the menu ever really grabbed my attention so I had the Rock shrimp appetizer and a side of Parmesan fries.  My two dinner-mates each ordered a sandwich with fries as well.  My rock shrimp were ok, nothing to write home about and my side of $6 fries was tiny.  My friend's side of fries on their sandwiches was a larger portion than the side I paid extra for.  \n\nBefore I wrote the place off, I wanted to stop by for breakfast since I had heard about their endless mimosa and blood mary special.  The special is a little confusing, if you aren't ordering a breakfast entr\u00e9e it $25 but if you do order an entr\u00e9e it is $15.  Our server was busy that morning but also was very spaced out.  Forgot to bring our joiner a water or silverware and was very non-existent.  The place was a little busy so I wanted to cut him some slack but he never wrote down our orders and then would come back to clarify on what we had ordered because he forgot.  The endless special seemed like a good deal until I realized they didn't make each refill on your mimosa but came around with a pitcher of pre mixed mimosas so some tasted like just OJ and some like a weak mimosa.  My friend who had the endless bloody enjoyed his deal, each bloody was a little different made each time (once with a slice of bacon, once with bacon bits, once with no bacon at all) but all in all thought it was a good for the price.  My $3 cup of coffee was not refilled, even when I requested.\n\nThe food on the menu was a different story.  I ordered the 3 breakfast tacos and requested a side of hash browns instead of home fries.  Our waiter didn't write down my order so of course it arrived with home fries but the food runner was happy to bring me the side of hash browns.  My friends enjoyed their build your own burritos but my food was subpar.  My tacos were greasy and lacked flavor.  Every time I picked up my taco for a bite, grease ran out the bottom.  Even my potato and egg taco was greasy and flavorless.  The hash browns were soggy and covered in cooking grease as well.  I'm all for a greasy spoon hang over breakfast but this was over board.  The server was happy to oblige our request for separate checks but again because he failed to write down our order, all our checks were wrong but by this time we were ready to leave so we paid what he gave us and left.  \n\nThe people watching WAS amazing.  It was noon on a Sunday and there were girls in full make up and going out clothes (not walk of shame either) and d-bags galore.  If I wanted to start a drinking game at RnR it would be drink when ever some dude in a plaid shirt high fives another dude.",0
"poor service, cold food, witnessed the wait staff being extremely rude to a family that brought their teenagers for lunch and play the ping pong, foosball, etc. \n\n I get that they are focusing on adults, but at 1 pm when the place is empty they should get over it...\n\nwont return. ever.",0
"I've been thinking to try this place for ever. I finally did and I'm sad to report that per my taco standards it's barely OK.\n\nI got 2 al pastor and 2 carne asada tacos. I also ordered the \""""cuatro\"""" (chips, salsa, guacamole and beans). \n\nBesides the $21 that this cost me, the food was absolutely uneventful. The tortillas were cold, the beans were lacking flavor, the salsa was meh and the guacamole was average.\n\nThe al pastor tacos were kind of sweet and if you've read my comments before, you know that I can't stand the heartbreaking moment when you expect something (because they name their dish the same of something you're craving) and you get something totally different or at least far enough from the real thing.\n\nThe carne asada tacos were OK but they had this indescribable green topping that was totally unexpected (in a bad way). I don't know what it was but i believe there was some onion and celery involved. Not authentic at all, at least nothing I've ever seen in Mexico.\n\nVeredict:\n\nIf you pass by, it's OK for a quick bite with low expectations, otherwise, I wouldn't crave it.\n\nCheers.",0
"Bought a 2012 Forrester here in July 2012.  Decent sales experience, however none of the work that was needed (2 non-safety-related recalls) or requested by me (installation of dog barrier in the hatch area) was done before I picked up the car, even though they had 3 days notice.  I had to schedule another service visit.   Then the cheesy-sleezy former computer salesman that wasted half an hour of my time trying to sell me extra coatings and protectants.  His best line:  \""""These glass wipes, that we include as a complimentary extra, they are so much better than Rain-X, and after you use one to wipe down your windshield, you can take it in your house and wipe down your bathroom mirror and it will NEVER fog up.\""""  No thanks.  Not for $5K.  Moron.\n\nWell then came the kicker:  3 months after buying my car, they are FINALLY fixing a damaged center armrest (the car was a loaner that some employee put 1,500 miles on before I got it), and when they give me the car back, there are 2 outside scratches and a nice big gash on this interior plastic trim part of the door.  I call the service coordinator, and tell him to send me an email so I have his address and can send pictures.  No email.  The next day I called the salesman, and said, \""""I need R.'s email address in service, please send it to me.\"""" No response.  Finally I get a \""""customer satisfaction survey.\""""  I let them have it.  I went back to have them fix one more thing (that they admitted to damaging when replacing the armrest), and then went elsewhere for all my service needs.\n\nYou would think they would treat a 3-month old car a little better.  I will never go there again.",0
Great job done and the doggie tie and the squeeze toy was a bonus.  Very courteous staff and high level of service.  Extremely reasonable prices and Alex was the most gracious and flexible in terms of appt and pick-up time.,1
"I was so excited when I saw a Thai restaurant opening so close to home but ugh, so disappointed.  I should have known to run when instead of asking what spice level I wanted on a scale of one to ten they asked if i wanted hot medium or mild. \n\nI ordered the Tom yum soup (hot) and got a bowl of bland broth (maybe just hot water?) with huge chunks of chicken and one shrimp, nothing more.  I also ordered the green curry (again hot) and it was literally the worst I've ever had.  Thai food is all about flavor, this was just tasteless blah.\n\nI'm giving them two stars cause the brown rice was cooked perfectly and my friends pad Thai was ok, but again, just ok.  Very disappointing :-(",0
"I'd heard great things, decided to take my mom and sister for dinner before taking them to the airport. Booked through OpenTable for 8:30 August 9th, and got there 8:25pm.  Waited a min or two and we were seated in an area that had prob a party of 16, so our table was by itself at the other end. Which we thought would make it nice and quiet.\n\nWaited a good bit to order bottled water. We had to ask the girl that wasn't our server to send our server by, we had plenty of time to decide on our order as we waited. I order the reg filet medium and my mom and sister both got the petite filet medium well. Also a few sides. Honestly I thought the prices were great, not the typical bloated a la carte prices.\n\nThe place had the a/c blasted and it got cold, and I'm a guy I love the a/c but was freezing.\n\nWe waited and waited... The large group finally got their food and our server said ours would be out next. Maybe the group put everyone's orders back a while. When it finally got to us it had been 70 minutes from the time of our reservation!!! As the food runner was placing the filets I couldn't tell the difference in the sizes (our server later said the petite is 6oz and the reg is 8oz pretty small in my book) I cut into mine and took a few bites and it was not medium. My mom and sisters were not medium well but theirs looked medium. Our server took her time checking on us and I showed her that mine was not medium which she agreed. She said she would talk to the chef, I said if I can be out quickly I would like a new one. She came back and said the chef told her he could make it butterfly style and have it some in 6 minutes. I said fine. \n\nInterestingly I went out with some friends a while back and we made fun of one of the guys for ordering a filet butterfly style.\n\nThe filet came out and it was fine. I enjoyed it, just not the hassle. Then we were thinking of getting desserts but again waited quite a while and finally asked the other girl again and she brought the menus. Our server finally came out and we said if they dessert was quick we could do it, again we were going straight the the airport from here. It came out and it was good as well.\n\nAnyway she comp'd the dessert (of course that was the least I would expect). Total was $126 and I still tipped $20 even though I honestly shouldn't have. If I had the time I would've asked for the manager. Figured I'd email the manager later when I have time. Guess what no email or direct contact info!\n\nSince I recently moved from Summerlin to Mtn's Edge I was thinking this would be a new regular steakhouse for my wife and I, prob not!",0
"Trying wayyyy too hard to be cool.  And thats saying something for Vegas.\n\nThe vibe here was just weird and kinda obnoxious in retrospect.  We dropped by for a quick bite and a cocktail early in the evening.  The restaurant had a 15 min wait, but the hostess offered us a bar seat immediately so we went ahead and took that.\n\nThe bartender was the saving grace of the whole experience, so kudos to the guy, but everything was setup to make his job impossibly hard.  \n\nWe ordered a couple of cocktails but the most basic of things like spirits and mixers were in complete disarray.  He had to keep offering us alternatives as they were out of things as simple as Sky Vodka.  He was completely apologetic though, and a good guy doing his best in difficult circumstances.  During our brief experience, he ran out of spirits, glasses, mixers the works.   He also had some other patrons who were complete idiots, making him jump through hoops, we really felt for him.\n\nAnyway, we settled in ordered a few sushi rolls and a tuna/jicama taco thingy and settled in.  We sat back, watched the chaos unfold as the kitchen also was completely backed up, and all the other patrons at the bar were demanding our poor bartender solve the worlds problems with a click of his fingers.  \n\nOur food took forever to come out, but we were happy to sit back and relax, take things easy and have a few drinks.  Unlike, of course, one certain patron sat next to us, who had waited just as long and demanded to see a manager, after giving said bartender an incredibly hard time.  The manager eventually came over and did everything he could to placate her, offering freebies and discounts on the meal.  With her now happy, he just wandered off, oblivious to us and our wait, or indeed anyone else.  Pretty classy :)  \n\nIn the end our order came out, after tons more waiting, and came out wrong to boot.  Our bartender had pretty much given up by now but knocked the price of one of the items of the bill for our wait.\n\nThe food was ok but nothing special.  Over priced for sure.  Sushi was decently made, fresh fish, but the rice tasted as if it was cooked some time ago.   The tuna tacos using thinly sliced jicama as a shell were nothing great either, good idea, ok taste, difficult to actually eat in practice.\n\nFairly poor experience all around, with only the bartender a shining light.  Nothing we could see to warrant a repeat visit really.",0
"Every place that sells food needs to be rated against peers -- so you don't compare a Jack to a Stratta or anything. So this place really needs to be pitted against other places, and in particular those in the immediate neighborhood, I think. \n\nThis place is great, and probably the best food choice when you're in that area. In the immediate area, there this, a Taco Bell (or Del Taco, I forget), McDonald's, and Wienerschnitzel. This place is always the fastest, provides the best food, and generally has the coolest people working there in that they're polite.\n\nOne time I went down here and I was starving after having worked a double shift. I rolled through the drive through and thought I should get enough food for then, plus some snacks for later. I ordered four tacos, curly fries, and jalapeno poppers AND IMMEDIATELY ATE THEM ALL. And all of the food was good and hot. Can't mess with that.",1
The best bruschetta ever.\nSo many delicious  flavor combinations.\nMake a meal of it.\nHighly recommended..,1

I had lunch there last Friday and they were advertising a Korean short rib lunch.   I took the bait and either they know nothing about Korean taste or they put black bean Chinese sauce on the short ribs by mistake.   It was very disappointing.,0
"This place just keeps getting worse and worse.  \n\nI've been in Pgh for a while now and honestly, I can't remember a time when I didn't go to Coffee Tree Roasters on Walnut as my go-to study/sit around/meeting place.  I loved the big garage door, the ambiance, the people watching, the free wifi...etc..etc.  The coffee was good and reasonably priced, with tea at hand if I felt like it.\n\nSince then the quality of the place and service has just plummeted.  Started with the bathrooms...rarely cleaned, rarely working.  Nowadays, if you dare to sit in the back near the bathrooms, the whole area reeks of stale urine or something.  It smells like the bathroom.  Inside, the toilets are leaky, the floors are often COVERED in water (lets hope) and paper...I partially blame the patrons for leaving these in such poor condition, but hey, management, could you possibly, i dunno...clean it?  I've gone a couple times in one day, once in the morning, and once after classes, and the bathrooms look exactly the same.  \n\nThen the service declined.  First they started making the \""""you must buy something to get internet.\"""" That's fine with me.  I always buy something there.  But then they started the 2hr limit...then free 2hrs, but then you have to buy something ELSE on top of whatever you bought initially...etc...etc.  Now half the time the internet doesn't work and no one on staff seems to care or know how to reset it.  They just look at you like you are lying about the internet because, hey, they saw someone using what looked to be the internet about 8hrs ago...or that's what their coworkers told them yesterday.\n\nThen the coffee also became watered down...and went up a smidge in price.  Still cheaper than SBux but its...not as quality anymore.  \n\nI still love it for the giant door into people watching in shadyside and its locale. But otherwise, it could be a lot better...because it USED to be a lot better.",0
"OMG! Never again! So I found a great rate through Orbitz so I prepaid for a room.  Big mistake! As soon as I arrived at the parking lot I was not feeling it. Then I go check in and get to my room. It was nothing like the picture I saw on Yelp or the hotel website! First of all, the beds were nasty! It was like visiting a distant relative and them putting you in their spare bed that's been left in the basement for years! There was hair all over the beds. I felt like I had bedbugs crawling all over me! Then I go to the bathroom...it gets even worse! There was rust and mold all over the ceiling in the bathtub. Then I saw the shower head was covered in limestone. But it gets even better...unknown stains all over the shower curtain...That's when I decided that I couldn't stay there. I called the front desk and asked for another room. They tried giving me a similar room.  No thanks! I didn't even care that I paid for the room...I just took off and checked into Planet Hollywood. I will never stay at the Flamingo!  I wouldn't even go to the casino! DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU CARE ABOUT CLEANLINESS!!!",0
"Closed at 2am instead of its advertised 3am... We saw people inside and the waiters saw us, but ignored us. \n\nChange your closing time to 2am so people won't be trying to come at 2:15am to a closed establishment.",0
This place is the best.  Great food and cold beer at reasonable prices. Try the Stromboli!  Just a great place.,1
"So I was pretty hungry once and came in this fairly new restaurant which was close to me. The cook was pretty nice, and the place was empty, sort of a grey atmosphere. I don't think one is meant to eat in this place - take-out seemed like the way to go.\n\nI wanted to check it out, so I got the Pad See Ew, for $10, which honestly, is very pricey. (literally everything is $10) The taste was decent, but the dish didn't pick up any flavor from the wok. The braised bits of beef were okay though. \n\nThe amount he gave really cheesed me though. If you pay $10, it's fair to assume you should be getting a good amount, but the bowl was half full. I understand why almost no one goes here. Thai Express is literally down the street and 2-3 bucks cheaper, a generous portion and honestly, tastes better - which is pretty sad. They claim to provide an authentic taste, but really, none of that was communicated to me through the dish, and I've been to Thailand.\n\nOverall, if you're a student or not - save your money and just go to the Thai Express if you want something vaguely resembling Pad Sew.",0
"This is literally a hidden gem on 16th Street and Bethany Home. There is no signage outside so you just have to find it. The place is TINY, essentially a bar and a few tables and a function room behind the usually closed door by the entrance. As with their sister restaurant Rokerij, the smell of burning wood permeates the place. They serve beer and cocktails and have a good selection of wine. The food here is great. If you don't mind waiting this is a great place for brunch. The green chile meatloaf is probably my favorite-it is served over a tortilla with beans and two eggs. OH IT IS SOOOOO GOOD!!!! I also had green chile stew which was fantastic as well. One of my favorite places to hit in Phoenix.",1
"Where do I even start? From the extremely slow service, the inflated prices, or the below par frozen hot chocolate?!\n\nIt was about 11pm at night and I just came from Mon Ami Gabi over at Paris hotel. I thought I would try serendipity for dessert since it is quite popular and the idea of a frozen hot chocolate is interesting. So me and my cousin arrived at Serendipity and we see a long line outside as well as an empty seating area. I was informed that inside sitting is for people eating in, and the line outside is for take out or basically drink orders. I got in line thinking \""""this should be fast\"""", \""""I'm sure they have plenty of staff considering it is summer and the weather is 105 degrees\"""". Boy was I wrong! It took forever due to shortage of staff!! It was finally our turn to order and I got the Amaretto Almond Frrrozen Hot Chocolate because a friend of mine recommended it. It was quite convenient of them not to have the prices on the menu. Not that I am cheap with food, but I would like to know what it is I am forking over for this drink. hahaha. So the total comes out to be $11.82 for the smaller size. Holy Moly!! I was shocked! but too late to back out now, after waiting for at least half an hour to order. Then I had to wait another 10-15 minutes for them to make the drink. I am thinking to myself \""""this better be the best drink ever!\"""" Again I was greatly disappointed. It tasted like iced down flavored Almond slush. I've had much better almond slushes in OC. Needless to say, I am never coming back here! It was such a waste of time and money! Don't buy into the hype like I did!",0
"I had a few hours to kill in Scottsdale the other day, so I decided to treat myself to a pedicure. I asked yelp who is good in the area. Yelp said these guys. Oh Yelp, you always know who's hot! I was helped right away to a pedicure chair by Andrew. He was friendly, and did a great massage. I was already won over, when he wrapped my legs & feet in steamy hot towels.......AMAZING!!!!!!! Thank you Andrew & Bronze Boutique. And thank you Yelp, for always knowing the spot!",1
"Fast lap is not worth the money. First they don't take GROUPON on Saturday, even though the place was empty and no where on the GROUPON did it state this. Secondly the staff was rude, probably another reason they were empty. There are better Kart racing in Vegas. Go to another place.",0
"This 2 star rating is actually generous! The casino is super small and offers a very limited number of games and slots. The slots are old and besides the decent music, there is little to no energy in the place. I am a local and this would be the last hotel i would visit off strip.",0
I like the occasional steak and shake stop.....    but this one has to be the slowest one ever.    The cashier was rude and I could hear her yelling are you fucking kidding me because the register was not working the way she wanted....     wow.... just wow...,0
"Stumbled upon this place with my husband and son - what a find!!! Loved the ambiance to start with - such a unique place with a patio that is perfect if you are dining with dogs! I had the iced tea (best I have ever had at a restaurant) and my son and husband had the Arnold Palmer - also delicious!. I had the southwestern salad - not only was it beautifully presented, but it tasted fabulous! My son and husband had the roast beef sandwich which they raved about! We will be going back to try breakfast! Service was friendly and our food was brought to the table not long after we settled in to enjoy our beverages.",1
"Great garlicky meal. Quick, friendly service. Moderate price. Large portions.  Will come again.",1
"I have been coming here on and off, but I have always got a great meal out of it. The food is very price worthy and, as I most probably wouldn't make this a place where I would hang out and drink, they have that option too. \n\nI had the schwarma last time, which basically is a pita wrap of the kind that can be found all over Europe. Tasty to say the least.. but I have to get better at trying out their curry dishes, because they look and smell fantastically. \n\nSome people say they have gotten bad service here, but I never have had a bad experience. It's very casual and I must say I appreciate that. As I said, its more a place to eat than a place to hang out at.",1
"This is a nice hotel but the staff is a little lacking. We reserved a King bed and when we checked in they only had 2 queens. So they \""""upgraded\"""" our room. All this meant was a room with a view if the pool the were working on.  In the morning when I was asked \""""how was your stay\"""", I replied \""""not very good since we did not get the room we reserved\"""". The hotel employees response was \""""sorry to hear the, you have an outstanding balance on the room do you want to keep it on your card?\""""   Horrible customer service!!!!",0
"We sucked it up and drove the 15 mins south to grab some good bar food at Harry's in a foreign place called 'Ayrsley'.  Luckily they still use legal US tender down there, so we weren't too far out of our element.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is pretty nice, and it comes across as a 'classy' bar, but the temperature was probably hovering in the range of 40-45 degrees...depending on the wind chill.\n\nWe fired some drinks right away and got the Harry Houdini and the Dirty Harry.  Both drinks were tasty, but seemed to be missing a key ingredient....alcohol.  The Dirty Harry was a quality mix of olive juice and olives, but a few sips in I could have really gone for some vodka.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered the pimento cheese, which was great.  The pita bread was warm and the jalape\u00f1o bacon jam was a nice complement.  We also ordered the Southern Sliders, which provides a decent sampling of 3 different burgers.  All were pretty good.  The beer cheese soup, on the other hand, was pretty tasteless and disappointing.\n\nIf I lived around there, I would probably head back to Harry's and grab some beer and maybe a burger, but it's not a place that was memorable or very impressive.  If you want to head there for a drink, make sure to bring a flask or order beer.",0
"We've got a promotion, saying 2 nights of Vegas AND 4 days Carnival Cruise for $199 , right?  We thought it was a great deal, so we bought the package.  We even got a $25 VISA gift card, too!!  YAY!\n\nTo get \""""free\"""" cruise, we had to go to Vegas first and attend this timeshare presentation.  The lady at the booth of Carlsbad outlet mall said, \""""No obligation.  No pushy sales.  No worries.\""""  Here we go!  We reserved 2 night stay in Vegas.\nOn the second day at 10am, we attended the presentation.  The presentation, personal tour and sales were very, very friendly, but diffidently PUSHY!  They were so nice but NEVER GAVE UP!  After many times of \""""No,thank you.\"""" they gave us a final offer.  Which is \""""trial membership\"""".  Finally we said \""""yes\"""".  Honestly, after close to 4 hours of sales, nobody could think straight and they never left us alone so we didn't have chance to discuss privately, either.  \nWe paid $795 (or so) and get 9000 points to use for \""""one year\"""".  It sounded really a good deal.  \n\nAfter we came back home, we carefully reviewed the paper and thought it over, right?\n\nFirst of all, they told us there was a financial plan and monthly payment is this amount, but they never told us how long to pay off and actual interest.\nSecondly, there is over $1000 maintenance fee... means, after we paid off everything, we still have to pay that amount (most likely increase future, right?).  \nThirdly, we waived the right for cancellation.  We both should have known better.  But as I said, we couldn't thin straight and we really thought we would NEVER cancel... but is it still right??  \nLastly, 9000 vacation points we got is for \""""one year\"""" but to process the membership, it takes 30 to 45 days.  Is this what they call \""""one year\""""?? \n\nWe looked up \""""free\"""" Carnival Cruise, as well.  Of course, there was a fee.  To get an interior bunk bed room, the fee is $372 (for 2ppl).  If we want to upgrade to interior non-bunk bed room,  \""""fee\"""" is $590.24 ($679.30 without \""""free\"""" cruise offer).  Of course this is fee for off season.\n\nRemember, they don't give us ANYTHING.  If you want to have a timeshare, you go and enjoy yourself.  The vacation villas were looked so nice. But if you want to have \""""good deal\"""" or \""""free stuff\"""", this is NOT a place for you.\n\nOh, I just realized that even $25 gift card was already expired the end of the month we signed up.  (Did the sales lady told us the expire date?  I don't think so.)",0
"I think I'm spoiled when it comes to Chinese buffet because I live in an area with fantastic buffets. Liang's buffet is not great. It fills your stomach but that's about it. Their buffet has a smaall selection of so-so Chinese food. On the plus side, service is good and there are times late at night when this restaurant is the only one along this block still open. That's worth keeping in mind if a convention is keeping you busy until late at night.",0
"I've never stayed at a hotel that charged me BEFORE I even checked in.  Then charged my card again after I asked them not to (I'd be paying in cash) because I couldn't avoid another over draft fee.

"Mind blowingly AMAZING restaurant. gorgeous ambiance, music, waitstaff is super nice and friendly... I don't even know where to start with the food ... stuffed waffles and ramen and a delicious sake margarita....

Please go here and keep them open so when i return someday for a visit I can eat this deliciousness again.",1
"It's sad that this Pasqual's even shares the same name as the one on Monroe st, because if this were my only Pasqual's experience, I'd never go back.  \n\nI used to love the old Atwood location, and the Monroe one is good too.  This newest addition just sucks.  First off, It's big and dark, yet like an old factory.  Huh?\n\nThe food selection is slightly different than the Pasqual's on Monroe street too.  Just weird stuff.  And what is with the bakery/coffee shop?  The table setup is strange too.  Every table is awkward, and the place is cold.\n\nJust do yourself a favor, and don't go here.",0
I should start by saying that I came here on Tuesday. There weren't a whole lot of vendors set up but I was saddened by how many of the ones who were there weren't even selling local produce. They had produce that was even target brand that was being sold and garlic from China etc. \nThey did have some local options but not many. I will have to go back on a weekend and see if the options are any different and update my review accordingly.,0
i dont think i'll even give a star.  stayed here one time about 4 years ago for a damn conference thing...hated it...service and etc.  rather stay at circuscircus,0
"4 nights in a two bedroom suite with floor to ceiling windows, jacuzzi, kitchen, and a massive projector for under 2 grand!  This is the hotel to be at for larger groups and the younger crowd who wants to party.  I definitely would not recommend this place for families (I don't know why families come to Vegas anyways).  It is pretty new and the rooms were clean.  It is connected to Planet Hollywood casino, you have about a 15 minute walk to the casino or the strip through the mall that connects them.  It's not too bad of a walk especially since you save all that money over the other places.  You are right across from City Center and Bellagio.  Their was no door on the bathroom on the master bedroom (it is around a corner), but the glass is frosted, but it is a little weird when you are with a bunch of your friends.  The other bathroom does have a door.  They have a small pool downstairs with jacuzzi, cabanas, and a bar, but definitely not a party pool like at Palms.\n\nI know Hilton bought it recently and I went while they were still transitioning, so just look out for other reviews to make sure they haven't become more strict on their policies such as noise and the amount of guests since they are a Hilton now.",1
"Maybe I missed something here, but I wasn't impressed. Had the cheese steak, which I can see had great potential but was...well...bland. Also had the arancini and it also was bland and a bit overlooked. Actually it tasted burned. Maybe just that evening but it all could have benefited from some more seasoning. Lots of other really good reviews so I'd likely give it another chance, but maybe not.",0
"This was a great dinner.  My wife and I were staying at the resort on vacation and knew we wanted a special meal... this did not dissapoint!  As many yelper's talk about, the Millionaire Tacos are fantanstic.. the 5 little mini tacos were just enough for a light start to a heavier meal... and do not get me started on the bread (rolls) as  could have just had bread and butter and walked away happy.  Drinks were yummy (both had mojitos) and main courses were perfect (Beef Tenderloin for me, Halibut for my wife).. we were also blown away by the side dish of smoked paprika garbanzo beans (with spanish chorizo)... it was an outstanding compliment to dinner. We opted for the Warm Chocolate Croquettes which were so good I wanted more even though I was full.  This is an OUTSTANDING restaurant!",1
"This is such a great shopping center, tons of good store. And did I mention that it is beautifully decorated and even better at the holidays? Love just going here in a date on the weekends with the hubby, lots of good places to eat including true foods and then walking around listing to the live music they have on the weekends. Also has pottery barn and restoration hardware to give you plenty of ideas for home decorating.",1
Can't complain! Definitely a nice place to drink while you wait for your table next door.,1
"Disclaimer - I got there late after a long poker session so only had the short menu they start serving at 10:30 pm.  Have read good things about the normal menu so will update this review if I ever have that.\n\nGot the beef sliders and mini corn dogs.\nSliders - Bland.  The beef wasn't really seasoned (though I guess that's standard in many places) so didn't really taste great.  The slider buns were pretty good - nice flavor and texture.  It let you eat your slider without things spilling everywhere.  But overall it just didn't taste that great.  Even the onions they serve it with get lost in the strength of the slider's sauce as well as the pickles served with it.  \nMini corn dogs with skinny fries - Corn dogs were, again, bland.  The batter had a nice texture but don't think it offered much flavor beyond just kind of a normal sweetness.  The dogs were made of decent meat (I think) but just not seasoned.  Fries were ok - but they did get soggy towards the bottom of the cup.  Not so bad since they would get cold served on a plate (there were lots of them).\n\nI'm willing to try again as it looked like a really cool place and the Aria poker room is my new favorite.  But the food, so far, was poor.  Service was kind of lacking too.  Bartenders spent a lot of time socializing while patrons were kind of waiting there for service.  My water glass went unfilled my whole meal.",0
"Where do I even start with this one...\n\nFirst off, let me say that the staff was friendly and welcoming.  And that was where the positive experience ended.\n\nMy girlfriend and I stopped in here on a Saturday on the way to a friend's house because we were looking for a quick bite and this place had good reviews.  I love good frybread so I was excited to see what this place had to offer.  I was sadly disappointed.\n\nI tried the Dev's chicken dish and my girlfriend tried another dish that I can't recall the name of.  I really can't believe that what came out was the standard that this place goes by.  The frybread itself wasn't bad but was pretty bland.  The rest of the stuff on top was even more bland than the frybread.  There were way too many refried beans on this thing and I think I got half of a head of lettuce on top of that.  I think there was chicken buried in there somewhere but it sure didn't taste like it.  There was absolutely no flavor to this thing which is impressive because the ingredients should have come together nicely (should have...but didn't).  I even tried to spice it up with the hot sauce they gave us and that had no flavor either.  My girlfriend didn't fare any better as her meal looked and tasted like a full can of refried beans and the other half of the head of lettuce that ended up on mine.\n\nShortly after we had begun eating some guy came out from the kitchen and asked if everything was ok.  The way he asked it though indicated that he was trying to see if he had made it correctly rather than simply seeing if we were enjoying the meal.  It was so awful that I simply didn't have the heart to tell the kid that it was some of the worst food I have ever had.\n\nPlease understand that I do not consider myself a food snob or anything like that.  This meal simply was poorly done and had zero taste to it.  I got through half of it and had to throw the rest away...and I hadn't eaten anything else all day so I was really hungry.  I also tried one of their house juice drinks that they had available.  The peach-melon sounded tasty.  It wasn't.  It tasted like drinking cantaloupe juice.\n\nIf you are a frybread company then you should at least do the frybread really well and then build on top of that.  This place just didn't have it together I'm afraid.",0

"The 2 stars are for the decor and that's about it. The service was non existent as the staff was too busy talking with each other vs. their customers. Margarita was ok but I'd suggest 'no rocks' because it was mostly ice like a fast food place. Enchiladas were cold, fajitas were ok. Had to actually ask for silverware...ridiculous. They charge for chips & salsa so I expected a better product, I think it was from a jar. Skip this place.",0
"My used car was ready to take home 3 days later than Findlay North PROMISED it would be ready when we were in discussion. By the time it was delivered, I had left for a trip out of the country. Their lie was extremely unprofessional and caused much inconvenience to continuously have to call the dealership to hear that to they had lied to me and my car would not be ready before I left the country for my trip. The manager fed me a bunch of crap about the price that was different from what I had agreed to with the salesman. \n\nIn addition, there are multiple scratches on the hood of the car. Every other dealership that I have ever bought a used car from has had the decency to fix up scratches before giving it to the customer- further showing me why I should not do business with Findlay North.\n\nIt is completely unacceptable for a reputable dealership to lie to customers and offer such poor quality, which is probably why their customer parking lot was completely empty. I am a fan of Volkswagen cars, but I will be servicing my vehicle and purchasing future vehicles from any VW dealership OTHER than Findlay North. I will be letting my family and friends know about the service I received.",0

"Without a doubt Rotato offer a good baked potato, cooked on a rotisserie until the skin is crisp, while the inside remains soft and fluffy it almost doesn't need any filling.  However fillings are offered and if I am honest they are a little generic (essentially predefined combos of standard sandwich/potato fair) and it is a little pricy compared to other baked potato offerings in a student focussed area... \n\nStill as long as they keep cooking the potatoes as well as they do I will keep coming back for a decent filing hot lunch.",1
"This is a great little authentic Italian restaurant in the city. The food is done perfectly and it's cheap to boot. Everyday they have specials (closed Monday I think) and it's a good fast place to come for lunch as well.

Just popped into Bicycle Haus this past week looking for new components for my ride. I was looking at a custom order  (~$1500 worth).

Turns out the guy was on Facebook the whole time....very disappointing.,0
"My boyfriend raved about this spot for the longest. I finally got the chance to try it for myself. Omg the first spoon full of my house gumbo was AWESOME!! We were so greedy we ordered double crab, shrimp, chicken and lobster! The gumbo was seasoned to perfection. I ordered mine at a #7 which was a little too spicy for me. I haven't stop talking about this spot since I left Vegas. This will be my \""""go to\"""" spot every time I go to Vegas!!",1
"Marley's is everything a person is looking for in a casual dining experience. The staff is amazingly upbeat and nice. They are always quick to greet you with a smile. The ambiance is very inviting, there are comfortable booths with high backs for privacy. There are a few flat screens around the perimeter of the restaurant to watch the game on. The is also a small separate bar area that seats about 10 people.\n\nThe menu is the staple of this dining experience! although the menu is somewhat condensed, the diversity is absolutely superb. there is a hint of southern soul food, all american dishes, some italian influence and by far some of the best desserts i have ever had.\n\nThe staff, though small, is like a family. every time my girlfriend and I go in everyone from the servers to the owners approach us to welcome us and converse with us. And the prices!!!! every time we go in we  have an appetizer, entrees a couple of drinks and sometimes dessert and we have never spent over $40 there. \n\nAs much as i would love to suggest a dish to try, I cant pin point just one. i can honestly tell you i have not had a single dish here that was even just ok. everything is on point.\n\nThis place is a perfect example of a well executed dining establishment and if you are looking for a place to dine in Surprise, you would be doing a disservice to yourself by not trying this place",1
"Love the remodel. But the front desk is a complete joke. Slow!! Check in and check out, only two employees with a line out the door. Stacy was exceptional SLOW and worthless. Would love to give more stars, but just can't due to front desk.",0
Terrible service and food was barely passable. Wait service was unorganized and rude. If you go to this restaurant and don't look like a rich person they will treat you like a second rate customer. Went for birthday celebration and was very let down. NOT worth it!,0
I love this store and they are never lacking for cool things to buy and try!  My kids LOVE going in here and finding new things to learn how to make!!  There is a little lacking in a few of the employees but the others totally make up for it.  \n\nWell worth the dollar.  :-),1
"Tried the all you can eat, Although some items have a one person per item limit it is still a very good value. The sweet shrimp and sea urchin were really fresh.

"I love this place.  They have so many things you can find from many different countries.  So many types of pastas, all kinds of jellies, honeys, biscuits, etc!  Even Fresh Seafood.

So I paid it- no big deal...it just means I am going to have to shop there more.  \n\nTo go there...you need to go in the morning otherwise you will not have enough time to see everything.

"When I came back home to Pittsburgh and walked into the Wine Loft, I was thrilled at the decor like many others. Looked like somewhere I would find in LA or DC. I enjoyed that on Mondays they have $5 Martinis, Mojitos and Manhattans and then on Wednesdays they have $5 wine by the glass. I did expect this place to be more expensive being new and in the up and coming location of Southside Galleria, so I was content/happy with the prices.  It's all appetizers, but they are good portions. There were three of us and we got 4 different apps and were all full and satisfied. The pizza is VERY good. We went on a cold Monday night, so it was pretty slow, only one waitress on and she busted her ass because it was a bit too much for one person. Her service was still good and the food and drinks came out really fast. I know someone complained of not having anything available, but they had everything we wanted when we went. I plan to come again with a group of girl friends for my birthday! Hopefully I will still walk out a fan.",1
"Since I go to college out here in Vegas, I am technically a local. And this nightclub is one of my favorites on the strip. The decor is nice. And the dance floor is small in comparison to like Tao @ the Venetian, Pure @ Caesar's Palace, and RA @ the Luxor. But on a Friday or Saturday night it has a pretty good crowd. Most of the crowd in there 20's and early 30's. Yes they have go- go dancers who pop up from time to time. The bartenders are nice, and all of the times I have been, my friend's have given me one of their VIP passes so we didn't have to pay cover.",1
"I was so upset about this place that I had to write my first review today.  I went to Carolinas today and placed my order.  I waited for about 15-20 minutes.  People who ordered after me started to get their food.  So I went up to the counter to the lady calling out numbers and giving the food to the people.  She couldn't find my order.  She was starting to tell the cooks to make my order but at this point I asked for my receipt back because I wanted my money back.  The girl said without being apologetic that I needed to go over to where I ordered to get my money back.  So I went back to the guy who took the order and asked for my money back.  He didn't ask what happened just opened the cash register and handed me money.  No apologies from anybody or acknowledgment of the fact that we waited and had no food. \nI think this place has okay food but I will never go back because this food isn't SO great that I need to deal with the service that doesn't care about keeping customers happy. \nThere are much better places that I don't fear food poisoning from that are really nice to their customers.  I say the previous sentence because people who have been the place know that it isn't the nicest place.  In fact, it is the worst looking place that I have ever seen.  I can't believe I've eaten here in the past due to the way it looks.",0
"Gallagher's was delicious and service was great and surprisingly inexpensive for a group of 9! \n\nEverything was perfectly cooked, perfect temperature, and perfectly delicious!\n\nBetween the 9 of us, we had Steamed Clams, The Maryland Crab Cakes, The Calamari, The Caesar, The Wedge, The Clam Chowder, Dry-Aged New York Strip, Filet, Rib-Eye and the Surf & Turf (Filet and Lobster Tail) and Four Cheese Macaroni, Colossal Baked Potato, Saut\u00e9ed French Green Beans, and Loaded Mashed Potatoes all were equally delicious!\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The dry aged New York is sooo perfect!",1
"Consider me jaded, but if the Goretorium's goal is to become THE adult haunted house in the nation, they've got a long road ahead.\n\nFirst of all, the place is pretty damn expensive for a 15 minute Vegas attraction, definitely moreso than haunted houses in general. They say it is an \""""experience\"""" and that you can take your time to truly enjoy the haunt. That's bullshit, considering every single set piece actor basically tells you to go ahead after their done with their act.\n\nIt seems the Goretorium wants to attract based on a pedigree of violence. The problem is haunted houses have been springing up all over the country based on the same premise; most notably Chambers of Horror in Atlanta, GA. If the Goretorium came around during the height of Roth's popularity, circa 2005, this would have been a new experience. Instead it's just another name on the list of \""""adult\"""" haunts.\n\nWhat really disappointed me was that I assumed this would be an amazing experience. Everything on Vegas is blown to larger-than-life proportion, so I naturally assumed a brand new haunted house in Vegas done by a recognized genre director would really set the pace.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nI really don't want to spoil things, but there are a TON of just lazy special effects and poorly thought-out set pieces. I'll give a few pretty obvious examples.\n\n- In the very beginning of the haunt, there are two elevator shafts they tell you to avoid. Two big problems here: the illusion of an actual elevator shaft is easily discernible by wear around the edge of the mirror that is set into the wall. You basically see the border of the trick, so to speak. In addition, there is a light elevated about 10 feet into the shaft. It perfectly reflects 10 feet below the shaft. When trying to trick someone, you draw attention AWAY from the product causing the illusion, not TO it. This should be really dark, dark enough for you to casually look and think it is a real elevator shaft you might fall down,\n\n- There are two set pieces where a bride gets her armed ripped off and a woman gets her head ripped off. The problem is they just sort of pull and off it goes. There isn't any force behind it. It's just lazy. On top of that, the bride has a slight mist of water that sprays out from literally the opposite direction she's standing at. Why would I get sprayed from the left from an action that happened to my right?\n\n- There is a fairly cool set piece right afterwards of a zombie attack of the dinner party. There are all these cool gory dinner meals that have maggots on them. The maggots are a light filter above. There is no sense of dimension obviously.\n\n- There is what I can only describe as a \""""tunnel of guts\"""". Netherworld and tons of other haunted houses have the same thing, a spinning tunnel that is meant to make you nauseous  by creating an optical illusion in the tunnel that messes with your depth perception. In addition, they usually mechanically shake the bridge to make it worse. There is no optical illusion with this that I can tell, just a spinning wall of meat you walk through on a fixed bridge.\n\n- There is a reliance on LCD screens for WAY too many things, from the ticket line to the exit. The act that occurs in the elevator is totally ruined by the all-too-obvious glow of LCDs. I can only describe it as that awkward feeling when you see bad CG in a movie.\n\nNow, on a positive note, the exit is actually pretty cool. I can only describe it as you being birthed to the exit which leads to an overpriced bar and a cool wall of severed baby heads on saws..\n\nFrankly the best part was an awesome white t-shirt with a bloody stain around the neck. You can buy that online. If you're a real horror fanatic like I am, maybe if you have nothing better to do you can see it once just to say you did it. Otherwise, save your money.",0
"There are not many option for the West Island of Montreal for pubs ( unfortunately) We have not dined downstairs at the bakery, so this rating is refelctive of the the pub upstairs. Beer on tap is OK along with the food however the layout of the pub is terrible. Major portion of the pub is taken up with a dual stairway that is lit up like an operating room. Once upstairs the high stools and tables associated near the pub area are too large hence room is restrictive to move around the area. A line of stools circle the top of the stairs, facing a TV however the lighting from the stairway takes all the atmosphere out of the place. Some initial planning did not take place when the upstairs was designed. Only way to imporve is to gut the upstairs and bring someone in that knows how to lay out a floor plan. \nWe will stop by for a beer now and again but more by default than really wanting to go.",0
"Im sitting here, listening to some excellent alt rock i dont know, across a table from my girlfriend, enjoying a coffee and an excellent breakfast burrito, and i cant help but think there are very few places i would rather be on this saturday morning. Its my first visit and i'm hooked. Try this place if you want a genuinely amazing multipurpose cafe experience.",1
"The food is full of calories and completely empty. You'll down 1500 calories in a couple minutes and leave hungry. Plus, no nutritional guide on their website? ? For real? Even Burger King and Mcdonalds have nutritional guides! And by comparison, you should probably eat there. You'll be downing the same amount of calories from BK/McD's that you'll take in at Zupas; you might as well leave satisfied. (Not that I recommend eating BK or McD's on a regular basis.) I think this place tries to appear healthy, and they're definitely trying to present a product that is superior to fast food chains. A little more bourgeois for the types that refuse to eat at traditional fast food joints. However, the devil is in the details. I would say this place is dangerous for anyone trying to lose weight. And It appears that those who are looking for \""""healthier\"""" fast food options, are Zupas secret demographic. (And young people, of course. Quite obviously! There's a smart phone charging station, Duh!) You'll leave this place filling light, completely unaware that you just consumed about the same amount of calories found in a Double Whopper. And then an hour later, you'll be eating again. No worries, Zupas asks \""""please don't hold your table\"""" not that they really give you a choice. Large reverse vacuum pipes blow subzero air directly above most tables. Therefore, they'll definitely be a free table waiting for you to come back and consume more! \n\nIf you're not a calorie counter, the food is decent enough, I guess. If you're hungry when you leave, however, I wouldn't say it's a very good value.",0
Great variety and reasonable prices but the customer service leaves something to be desired. I'm never greeted when entering the store and its rare that the sales staff will ask if I need anything. I would shop there more if they had better service.,0

"I had high hopes for Iceberg - it seemed like a fun idea and I was looking forward to some yummy shakes. \n\nRegrettably, it was just not very good.\n\nThe exterior is the corner of a small strip mall, the interior is elaborately 50s dineresque.\n\nWe visited at around 9:30 or 10:00 on a weekend evening for shakes. There were NO other guests in the dining room and two employees at the register. \n\nWe ordered, the employee was a typical teenaged fastfood employee - took our order but she didn't really make any other impression other than being very casual in her speech. \n\nWe ordered shakes - I got the smaller size, my husband got the larger option. They took a looong time - probably 10+ minutes, which I thought was strange since there weren't orders in front of us. \n\nThe \""""shakes\"""" looked really odd when they came out - the shake stood up above the top of the cups. Although we'd ordered different sizes, there seemed to be the same amount of shake for both - the cups were just slightly different: super weird! \n\nIn my opinion, a defining characteristic of a shake is that it is drinkable, through a straw. These were not... they were simply soft serve icecream that seemed to have been slightly mixed and then put into the cups. I got a chocolate peanut butter shake, which was chocolate soft serve mixed with a bit of peanut butter (like, Jif or something along those lines) My husband got chocolate, so it was just chocolate soft serve. The icecream itself wasn't flavorful at all, and wasn't even satisfyingly creamy. \n\nIt was altogether disappointing and I don't recommend it, unfortunately.\n\n:(",0
"As a bar / music venue I highly recommend it. It's fun, the drinks are reasonable and generally the patrons are cool and there to have a good time. As a hotel I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. The rooms are filthy; seriously the tile hadn't been cleaned in months. I dropped a wet towel on the bathroom floor after taking a shower and when I picked it up it was covered in a heavy coat of dirt. We stayed for two nights and our room was never serviced, not once. When I called to complain they sent up a dirty bartender to drop off towels and toilet paper with no apology. The elevator was last serviced in 2001 and expired in 2006. The place is a cheap-ass motel at best; I' mean everything is dirty, the rooms, the stairways, the elevator; ugh!!! \nThere is no lobby, hospitality manger or anything of the sort; all hotel affairs are handled by the bartender. And, they never answer their phone, ever. Don't believe me, try it for yourself.\n\nThe only plus side is the music scene, shows they book, and the swing dancing; oh and free WI fi. Although the password was difficult to acquire, the first two people asked had no idea what it was. \n\nGo there to see a show but for the same rates or less stay at the Stratosphere or the Sahara (right up the street) where you don't have to sleep in misery",0
"I rarely give reviews below 3 stars, however, this is one of those experience that deserved a 2 star award.  We came here around 1:00pm without a reservation and didn't have to wait long for a table, but I soon see why the wait is not long and the restaurant is not packing with people waiting in line. Here is the score card and summary of the experience:\n\nDecor: 4, being a restaurant in Wynn, it's expected the standard to be high and it's very flower-y inside but things really go downhill from that point.\n\nService: 3, average service, brought your food over, refill your drink at a very slow pace, and we were not really asked how was our food and was charged 18% for gratuity because our party's size (9 people), which I don't really think they deserve.\n\nFood: 1, I ordered a BBQ bacon burger and the food came in under-flavored and was way too greasy. Ordered the burger at medium well but turned out to be well done. \n\nValue: 1, for the food that we ordered, it was totally over-priced. I really expected much greater things for a burger that's $17. (no sides)\n\nThis restaurant is right next to pool at Wynn, but even if the pool is filled with America's Top Models, its food's lameness would not persuade me to come back.",0
"This cute little Westmount cafe and actually convinced me to try Quinoa again, and this time I didn't mind it at all. (All 5 other times I've tried it, I've hated it)\n\nWalking into the half basement location, it was unsuspectingly cute! There are about 6 tables or so for customers as well as two counter spaces (4 chairs a piece). The server/host/barista was super friendly and courteous. We came on a Sunday and there are different menus for Mon-Fri vs. Saturday and Sunday. I had a fantastic chai latte (with soy milk), it was aromatically delicious, and the poached egg on quinoa and mixed greens. The dressing was zippy and the egg was poached perfectly. I remained skeptical until the 3rd bite and surprised still at how I didn't not like it!\n\nIt was pretty busy, with each empty table overturning within minutes, and we stayed for a bit eating, drinking and chatting! Definitely worth coming through!",1
This is the  is worst pizza place u can go to everythings gross health dept needs to visit this place asap and they say Italian ya rite,0
"I unfortunately don't have many positives for this beautiful, high-tech facility.  First, you are sent patient forms in the mail to complete prior to your visit.  Then you are told to go online and fill out a \""""digichart,\"""" which takes about 30 minutes asking you all kinds of questions (many unrelated to an OBGYN visit, mind you).  These questions don't stop at just a general FYI - they prompt you for very thorough answers.  One question was about past surgeries, asking about my tonsillectomy, including date of it.  What on earth does an OBGYN need this information for?  Half way through the 30 minute questionnaire, I had to make a comment of \""""too many questions!\""""  Once you are finally ready to submit your answers, guess what - if you left ANYTHING blank, it prompts you to go back  through the entire process.\n\nFinally, the day of my appointment - I get there about 20 minutes early.  They make you take a photo for your file - which again shows how high-tech and fancy they are.  The facility is gorgeous, which leads me to believe they may be overbilling insurance much?  I then had to wait an additional 15 minutes after my scheduled appointment time to be called into the back.  Once there, the 18 year old office assistant proceeded to ask me yet 20 + more questions! I couldn't believe it.  She then tried to sell me on skin care products, to which I asked her about pricing and she was clueless!  I was so annoyed at this point.  Then I was brought to my room to change and wait for the doctor.  After waiting half naked, in a freezing cold room, for now another 45 minutes, I finally popped my head out to find someone and ask how much longer.  About 10 minutes after that, the doctor finally saw me.  She made some small talk about my hair and tattoo, and did not ask anything about my general health or ask about anything about what I had provided in my questionnaire relating to my issues relating to my visit.  I decided I should inform her, because I need to see the doctor every 6 months usually, and as soon as I told her that, she said she felt a bump on my ovary and that I now needed to come back for an ultrasound.  This was totally unrelated to my other condition and I was beginning to wonder again about the overbilling insurance and their state of the art facility.  Coming from La Jolla, CA I have never even seen such a facility!  I then told her I wanted to get routine blood work done and she said she would get that taken care and get me out of there in no time.  She apologized for the long wait.  I then waited another 10 minutes for an assistant to come to the office for the blood work.  She prompted me down the long hall and told me to check out and wait (again) to be called for lab work.  The same assistant that initially checked me in came back by and said that I needed to fast for one of the lab tests and that I could wait and do the other now.  I checked out and took a seat to be called for blood work.  After waiting for about another 25 minutes, I saw that same assistant and asked her how much longer it would be, because I had now been there for over 2 hours for a procedure that takes a total of 10 minutes, tops.  The assistant asked why I was even still there, and I was in absolute furry by this point.  I told her she had said I was to wait for blood work.  She then replied and said she thought I was rescheduling all tests when I had to do the one for fasting.  I then left without doing any lab work.\n\nI had an ultrasound and a follow up appointment scheduled, to which I have just canceled.  Let me add one last compliant, I had to wait on the phone for 15 minutes just to cancel, with it telling me I was the 6th caller in line.  HA!  That was worse than calling the DMV!!!",0
"Still one of the best breakfast spots in town in my humble opinion. Steve the manager, the whole staff (today we had April and she was still top notch)are all truly delightful people. There isn't much new to report other than you need to try this place out if you haven't yet. You will love the cozy atmosphere, great food and super friendly staff.",1

"I LOVE Green. I am not a Vegan or even a Vegetarian, but I do appreciate great food.\n\nMy first time here was great because I went with a group and got to try bites of a variety of items. The hummus is my fave. It's got  a bit of a spice which I love and comes with deep fried pita (sometimes a bit too greasy, but I can deal). The artichoke appetizer is delish, but not anything like a traditional, so I wouldn't expect that. The salads are really yummy, I can't remember which ones I've tried, so I can't specify which are best. And today, I tasted heaven in the form of a tater tot. They just introduced sweet potato puffs and they are incredible. I will be getting these as a side every time now! And then there's the tsoynami. Most incredible frozen treat ever. I get the betterfinger with no choco chips, add peanut butter and double chicostix (sp?) SOOOOOO good words can't describe.\n\nI love it here so much that I make the trek from Ahwatukee to Scottsdale for lunch, salivating in anticipation, just to please my pallet a few times per month and it is worth every mile. \n\nAs mentioned in just about every review, the staff is incredibly friendly and always willing to make a recommendation if you ask. One time, when there was a mishap with my office's order that caused me to wait an extended period of time for pick up, I got a call upon returning to work from the manager with a personal apology. I can't recall another place EVER taking the time to do that. For this, I am forever loyal.\n\nReviewing this made me crave it all over again. I may have to go back for dinner. Don't judge me.",1
"If you have not stayed here yet, you should. This place lives up to all the hype. Everything is flashy and picturesque. The spa tower is just as good as the main building. The food is pretty good.

Not really full ever. \n\nTip: hold out for a non-smoking room if you can.",1
"This is the place I imagine sneaking into on an evening spent with that charming someone who captures your heart with the slightest smile. Late spring, strolling along the cobblestone streets window shopping when the sky darkens, and the clouds open up. Huddled under an umbrella, his arm around you to warm you from the sudden chill, you scamper down the few steps and duck into the warmth of Girasole.\n\nYou're immediately greeted like family; with a glow in the background as if a huge fire were burning. The small space is filled with lovely folks laughing, and sharing wine; eyes twinkling as they listen to the live music being played by the gentleman walking around strumming his guitar singing loudly.\n\nThe menu is simply simple Italian. The wine list is the sweet red table wine offered immediately after you sit down. The desserts are so worthy of the extra calories. Home made and delightful. \n\nAlmost as tasty as that good night kiss.",1

It's a tough decision because there are so many choices. Cute characters. Sometimes if I can't make up my mind, I buy two sets of stationery. I also find cute things at the store in the Ala Moana shopping mall. I also have a stamp card to that store rather than this one- kinda funny. I've liked Sanrio since I was a little girl (Hello Kitty, Little Twin Stars, My Melody were the older ones I grew up with)- I used to think that it was a largely Asian thing, but I see all kinds of customers in all age groups in these stores.",1

"I read recently that restaurants don't try too hard on Valentine's Day because they expect that their patrons are out for one nice meal and won't be repeat or regular customers. I had my doubts about that assumption until we went to Harvest last night. I can definitely say they lived up to the stereotype and that my husband and I will as well by not being repeat or regular customers. That being said, Harvest did some things well but bungled too many things for us to take another chance on this pricey restaurant. \n\nWe had an 8:30 reservation, showed up on time and waited about 20 minutes to be seated, along with a half a dozen other couples. I get that you're busy on Valentine's Day and that people take their time with their meals, but Harvest is not new to the game and should know better than to overbook their reservations. Also, there was nowhere to stand and wait except in the doorway or in the middle of a \""""nice little seating area\"""" as the hostess said, which turned out to be in front of another doorway. Also, the hostess was rude and condescending to me when I tried to check in and pointed out that we had been standing there for a few minutes without being acknowledged. I'd been standing on my feet serving the public all day too lady - no need to have an attitude. \n\nWhen we finally got seated, our waitress was very nice and attentive for how busy the restaurant was. I loved my Elderflower sidecar and my husband enjoyed his house martini. My first course scallops were amazing and came served in a very good sauce. I thought my husband's tuna confit was strange and didn't take another bite of it, but he enjoyed it. \n\nMain course - I ordered the hanger steak which came with a side of potatoes with leeks. The hanger steak was okay, but overall the entire dish was pretty mushy. It's definitely not something I'm salivating over thinking about it the next day. It wasn't super flavorful or memorable, there wasn't much seasoning and really nothing that I can say makes me want to try it again. To sum it up in one word: meh. Which is a shame because I had an excellent hangar steak at Eno Vino not too long ago, which is what inspired me to try it at Harvest. \n\nMy husband had the NY strip steak, which I thought was very chewy. Again, not a memorable dish but he seemed to enjoy it. \n\nWe ordered one dessert to split between the two of us and tried the chevre cheesecake. The cake itself was good but the fruity stuff they put on top was so bad I couldn't take another bite. It was so horribly tart. \n\nHusband and I both agreed the scallops were the highlight of the meal, which is sad because I've had amazing scallops elsewhere. So I can't see returning for just that. \n\nThe piece de resistance was when we were waiting to pay the bill. We were seated near the door, so we got an eyeful when a Jimmy John's delivery guy came in with a huge sandwich order for the staff. He was quickly ushered back into the kitchen to unload his delivery, but not before it was made pretty obvious what was going on. Harvest, don't you have a back door somewhere? For what I thought was supposed to be an upscale place (for which the price accurately reflected but not much else did) , that was pretty much the tackiest thing I've ever seen. Seriously? \n\nI was pretty disappointed about the whole experience, not just because it was Valentine's Day but because my husband and I live in the neighborhood and have walked by Harvest hundreds of times, promising ourselves we needed to try it. I can tell you the anticipation was much better than the meal itself, and unfortunately we will not be returning.",0
"We no longer buy our meat from this place because the quality of service and product has been going down and down over the last year or so. After having to throw away the ground beef for the second time, we finally made the switch to I-Mart for all our meat related purchases. When we would ask for extra lean ground beef, we would have to pay an astronomically high price AND it was still not extra lean. It was full of fat and seems like they were mixing in lamb with it too because it stank like hell. \n\nI was getting tired of being badly treated by the butchers who conveniently went deaf when we would ask for something (not in Arabic) but would be completely on their toes helping whoever spoke in Arabic exclusively with them. One time when I asked for a woman to repeat herself behind the counter, she literally stared and me for a few seconds and moved over and started helping someone else. I guess we are not good enough for them to help over there. \n\nWe still like the Al-Hana restaurant and they do offer some good spices that we will go in and purchase but we will no longer be using their meat counter.",0
I just don't get it.  The pizza is nothing better than average.  Anyone from NY will tell you it takes much more than a thin crust to make an NY pizza.  The service was very good and the Caesar salad was fantastic.  My quest for good pizza in Las Vegas continues.,0

"This is not a gourmet restaurant, but it has a gourmet menu.  The cuts were tough and just weren't prepared well.  The steak was very inconsistent, as if it were not tenderized properly.

"I joined Yelp JUST to give these guys the review they deserved.\n\nI have moved through 10 different cities in 5 different states and have utilized all sorts of different moving companies (Starving Students, Two Men And A Truck, Budget Movers, ARS Movers) as well as rented U-Hauls and moved myself.  Just In Time movers are hands down the most professional, courteous, efficient and honest moving company I have ever had the pleasure to work with.  The person who did the dispatch on the phone not only gave me an accurate assessment, but also recommended different moving plans based on how cost-effective it would be for me in the end.  On moving day, I had Mike and Mike as my movers who showed up 10 minutes before the appointment time and prepped their truck and equipment so that my billed time started when they actually started to move my stuff.  I was moving a 2 bedroom set from the 11th floor of a high-rise condo in Downtown Phoenix to a 3rd floor apartment unit in Peoria and the entire process took 2 1/2 hours from start to finish.  I was completely blown away by not just how fast and efficient Mike and Mike were, but also by how friendly and professional they were in the process.  All costs were communicated upfront with no hidden fees.  They ended up actually executing the move an hour less than what was assessed in my quote (with one less mover recommended).  I saved an hour's worth of moving costs, but I gave that in tip anyways because I was so impressed with their service.  Just In Time movers will ALWAYS have my business for any moving needs from now on and I am DEFINITELY recommending them to all my friends, family and co-workers.",1

"first off, I'm not the same city as my mom as this is going on so I'm very worried when all this goes down... I had to work but plan on going to see her when she gets released from physical therapy.\n\nThe day my mom was getting released from the hospital after getting knee surgery. Earlier that morning my mom knew she was going to Advanced Health Care. They had a list of patients to be transferred there and my mom was first on the list.\nAs the day went on about 3 hours prior to her being sent to Advanced Health Care they dropped the ball on my mom. There is no room for her. They took in these two other patients instead of her and left her with no where to go!!! My mom was ahead of these other patients!!!!!\nSo in the last hour the doctors and scrambling around trying to find a rehab facility for her. luckily she got in somewhere.\n\nThe story goes on... \n\nI decided to call Advance health. My reasoning was they screwed my mom over last minute and everyone of her friends and family thought she'd be at Advance Health care.\nSo I call and decide to ask for my mother.\nThey she said wasn't there. \nI asked where she was\nThey said they didn't know and hung up on me!?!?!\nI called back and inquired about what had happened with my mom. They said her name wasn't on ANY records of anything about coming in there. (BULLSHIT!)\n\nThis is my theory. I think Advance Health is for old rich people that don't know whats good for them. I have a feeling they baby their patients a little too much and don't give the proper adequate care people deserve. It's not about being put in a resort after you get surgery. It's about getting better and doing the proper therapy. \n\nI have a funny feeling that the people that got into Advance Health Care flashed some extra money and that is how they got in.\n\nI like where my mom is now she is with younger people at a more intense facility which I think she is strong enough for anyways.\n\nMy final thoughts on dealing with Advance Health Care. If you wanna see how wrong our medical system is look no further than this place. They are liars ( I know the real story that happened to my mom), irresponsible with their planning and quite frankly. RUDE NURSES.\n\nI highly recommend this place: HealthSouth Scottsdale Rehabilitation\nIt's younger people, better care. It might not smell like lavender and cinnamon candles but I think she's getting the therapy she needs and is really enjoying it.",0
"Old Vegas.  You are really just a step above you're ugly cousin, Reno. \n\nBut Binions...oh, Binions...\n\nYou are kind of like Ballys' skanky auntie.  You know, the one no one talks about since she came out of rehab.  The one who likes to wear all that flashy gold jewelry with open toe shoes and you know she hasn't had a pedicure in a few years.  THAT auntie.    \n\nI sat in silence as I watched El Hub and friends play craps.  Of course this was after the picture taking adventure with the Mr. T little person standing outside.   I proceeded to observe two older ladies with matching fanny packs try their luck on the \""""QUEEN: FREDDY MERCURY\"""" slot machine.  How many times can you hear \""""Another One Bites the Dust\"""" over and over?  I wasn't willing to find out.  \n\nNot really a breath of fresh air from Fremont St.",0
"After reading extremely positive reviews for this place, I was so hyped to come spend Sunday football here. I also read negative reviews & hoped that I wouldn't experience something like that but sadly, here I am writing a 2-star review.\n\nI've been to a bunch of hole-in-the-walls so I didn't mind the exterior but we walked in to a dark, empty bar & I just had an uneasy feeling. Sure it was early but it's Sunday! Where is everyone?! After sitting for a while, I also realized how warm it was in the place & that the fan was so loud somewhere in the back. Urgh.\n\nThere was only one bartender/server but she was accommodating & friendly. She immediately changed the channel to the game without us asking (based on the bf's jersey), which was really nice of her. We received our menus-- two crumply, stained pages with sharpie markings all over (they raised their prices so they crossed out some prices & wrote the actual prices in sharpie & they crossed off items they don't have anymore). She apologized that they are revamping their menus but damn, would it hurt to at least print their menus nicely on stock paper/resume paper just until they get their real menus? \n\nIt took about 40 or so minutes for a burger & 2 breakfast platters. Uhhhh.. Didn't get why it took so long; the other 2-3 patrons were already eating! While watching the game, a bug crawled up my friend's arm too! Not cool. There were a total of 4 other people who came while we were there & they weren't together either. It was awkward & I honestly don't understand the positive reviews.\n\nI had good company plus the food & service were okay but I think we will just visit another sports bar for the next game.",0
"The place has no air conditioning, the service was awful.\n\nThe place is dirty and smells bad, the employees aren't even clean.\n\nIt's a shame that this is the closest DQ to my new apartment, but my girlfriend and I will not be returning to this location.\n\nThe ice cream we both received was melted before we even received it, and the reeses in my blizzard were whole and not even broken or chunks.\n\nI strongly suggest you go somewhere else, or go to Bahama Bucks which isn't very far.",0
The food is awesome. The pad Thai dish is my favorite. Get it wig he pork. All the Thai noodle dishes are great too. Especially if you like spicy. The service is great. Just wish they would get a bigger place. They're very popular.,1
Except chix wing.  Not that good food.   Service o.k.     Should think about that why not many customers here in such a good location..... Horrible French fri and onion ring.....,0
"Good but certainly not wonderful. Four of us decided to try it and all ordered something different. We all agreed the best of the night was the service and the atmosphere. Loud, but we expected that, they retained alot of the original decor which was a very nice touch. Food....it was ok. Expensive for the small portions in our opinion and we all agreed this would not be visited by any of us again. Wasn't worth the $$$$ spent for the food received. We actually went somewhere else later and had desert and \""""good\"""" coffee and discussed the new try. Again, it was the consensus of the group to NOT include the Southern Rail in our place to visit. We are not big eaters, but the portions were pretty small for $$$ charged. The salads were the biggest disappointment as there was no dressing to taste, the salads tasted like washed lettuce and no garnish and very little dressing. The entrees were very small portions and certainly not worth the price. Overall our expectation was to have a great time at an old place we had visited for years, enjoy a super dinner, and talk. We did not accomplish any of this. Best time was the book store next door. Oh, by the way...............DO NOT ORDER COFFEE...... they should offer \""""fresh' coffee or have an espresso bar for pour overs or americano's, capps, lats, etc.",0
"Tried the golden wings and pepper jack focaccia, both were very good, well portioned and well made. Not five stars though due to lunch took 1.5 hours and our bartender/bar waitress seemed to be overcome with tables and it took longer than expected to eat and get the bill paid and leave. I will definitely be here again for the golden wings and try the Philly spring rolls.",1
"Be patient while your food is cooking and you shall know what I mean.  The food is just awesome and not overly-priced. We went there on a Sunday, about 1pm and sat outside so we get to enjoy the free shows at the plaza... ahhhh \""""Venice, Italy\"""" atmosphere.  I don't exactly remember what my friends ordered but we all shared our food and i must say, the \""""baked apple pancake\"""" is a must.  Mango Peach smoothie was so yummy too! Staff is so friendly, too. =)",1
"Best deal on a full set of tires, and some of the most professional and quality service in the valley. Came highly recommended from a friend, glad we listened!",1

"Ok, \nLet me first start off with, this place is no longer M Sushi bar. It is Eastwind sushi, and I'm sure it is under new management. With that being said, I had been to M sushi a couple of times and LOVED it, I always forgot about this place and would settle for Yen (right around the corner from my house), UNTIL I realized that M Sushi was right down the street from my job. \nSo last night, I decided to treat myself and went here. When I pulled into the parking lot I immediately noticed the new signage, and a part of me got a little upset. But I thought, how bad could it be. 1st mistake getting out of the car. When I went inside instead of seeing a little spunky, well presented, high school aged girl behind or even near the podium, this girl with headphones, and obvious social problems emerges from a corner. She spoke under her breath I had to ask her to repeat herself at least 3 times before I got to my seat. -and I'm not trying to take shots at the girl, but she was not put together at all. her hair was down and I'm pretty sure when your around food it has to be up. She wasn't very personable at all, and when she went to explain something to me on my plate, she had her finger so close to my plate that she could have touched it if she had a sudden twitch or itch. \nThe food- I ordered calimari... my favorite.. (which is why i always came back to M sushi). Sub Par. it was over cooked and bland... about the only seasoning i could taste was the oil. And they paired it with some wasabi mayo. DISGUSTING, and way to spicy to not know what your dipping into. When I asked for another sauce the waitress was not very knowledgeable on what to bring or what was on my plate in the first place. The rolls were huge!. which normally i would feel like im getting my monies worth but, i was having to either try to get the whole thing in my mouth (haha that's what she said- sorry. not appropriate) or try to take bites of it, and we all know how well that works out. \nI do, however, believe that they are a tad bit cheaper then M sushi was. Less money for more rolls... I could be ok with. But I'll just catch Happy Hour at Ah-so, completely ok with me!\nWell long story short I was not very happy with this change in management situation.",0
"Came here for a large group dinner a while back, and I gotta admit that a slice of prime rib is one of favorite dishes, but it was somewhat lacking here at Lawry's. It was basically a slab of meat with some au jus sauce. I hate to say it but I've had a better slice of prime rib at Black Angus!\n\nRecommendations: Hit up the local Black Angus or Outback Steakhouse instead.",0
"Closed!\nI tried coming here twice in 1 week(i live down the street) & both times this place was closed! Doors locked, lights off....",0
Food is always consistent.  Staff always friendly.,1
"Pretty decent pizza in the Chandler area...you cannot go wrong with pepperoni....almost thin sliced and great sauce. The ambiance of this place is great with outdoor seating. On and it does have a decent wine selection...there pizza and wine....much better than pizza and beer. Just make sure to get 18\"""" pizza for 4+....might as well get two of the large pizzas while you are at it.",1
"Peepshow was actually a lot better than I originally expected it to be. Reviews seem pretty mixed but I was incredibly happy with the show. \n\nThe majority of dancers were great and a couple of them (Green..) were absolutely fantastic. The singing was also much better than anybody in my group expected and definitely added a lot to the show. \n\nCoco did great and was great to look at, although it's obvious she is only there to draw in a crowd. She's not bad, but definitely not as good as the real dancers. \n\nWe bought tickets through Tix4Tonight and were very happy with them. We bought the cheapest they had but it really didn't matter. The show was far from full and they basically sat everyone in the front 3 sections, nobody had bad seats as the entire back half was empty.",1
"I was all geared up to eat at the ELEPHANT of all Thai restaurants, but when I got there... it was too busy.  So the wife and I shuffled next door to this gem.\n\nI overheard this used to be \""""Yoshi's\"""" which kind of makes sense.  Its the same Japanese style bowls, but oh-so-much better.\n\nFirst off, they have pictures of their dishes plastered all over their walls and doors.  They all look good but then I heard an angel and she steered my wicked eyes toward the holy grail of dishes... Bulgoki.  I was overwhelmed.  I grabbed my wife's shoulder to avoid dropping to my knees in praise to the Japanese Bowl gods.  Lucky for me my wife is young and strong or I would have taken her down with me.\n\nI, of course, order the Bulgoki and my wife orders the Spicy Teriyaki Chicken.  My wife grabs a table outside and I grab a pomegranite and jasmine iced tea and as many napkins as my miniature hands could carry (in preparation for the feast).  The wait was nil.  If it had been any shorter of a wait, time would be going backwards and I would have been dining with Socrates. Thankfully, I was still with my wife and I joined her at our table.  Her Chicken was too spicy for our liking, but we both liked the Bulgoki. DUH!\n\nAnyway, this place is rockin'\n\nTo sum it up, the wait was great and the dish was delish.\n\nBTW Chris,  Its spelled with a G not a K! Like this \""""BULGOGI\"""".",1
"Wow REALLY EXPENSIVE. Not going back, there's no way I could afford it if I doubled my salary. Used to paying between $20-$30 and I left paying $97 after taking two 3 suits and a few of my girlfriends blouses. With that being said they did do a great job on fixing a hole in my pants.",0

"There are a lot of better places for locals. WATCH THE BILL. \n\nWe are locals and go to Red Rock every other weekend, and always have a great time, except at Lucky Bar.  We had friends in from out of town and after gambling for an hour decided to relax, have a drink and just catch up.  Be careful about what you get charged and what the bartenders and waitresses tell you.  I ordered 2 drinks - one tab was $8.00 - the girl told me $9.00 and I paid her, with a tip.  The 2nd drink the tab was $9.00 and the girl told me $10.00 and I paid her, with a tip.  I never looked at the tabs, just stuck them in my purse. I paid cash for both drinks. The next day, while cleaning out my purse I looked at the tickets, and one ticket says $8.00 and one says $9.00. \n  It appears that the standard business is quote more than the ticket and hope that no one looks. (which I usually don't).  Be careful, this is not a good business practice.  \n  Shame on you Red Rock Lucky Bar.",0
Sad to say that so far there's only been one person in the pharmacy dept. that has been friendly & helpful. The rest of the people who assisted me acted as if I were bothering them. Very poor customer service skills.,0
They will go above and beyond if you're not happy. Ashley the manager was super helpful. They also have a gluten free menu with great options.,1
"I went in to pick up a dvd set I ordered online. The cashier at the pick-up section was very rude. I asked for a store receipt and she rolled her eyes and told me that she was going to hand me a copy of my receipt. I understand the amount of teenagers who work at the store but I expected more well-mannered people. I also did not like getting followed by a staff member who probably thought I was going to steal. This is why I shop at Amazon, cheaper prices and great customer service.",0
This place is great. A nice central location. Super clean and organized. Friendly and knowledgable staff. And a really good varied selection. Everything you could ask for or need from a great comic book store.,1
"my bf and i were seated right away when we came here around 6pm. I had the Evelyn's pasta, which wasn't very good. It was on the light side, so I didn't enjoy it. My bf got some pasta with bacon, peas, and a creamy sauce, which was very good. We had two alcoholic ice cream drinks called caramel twister and kahlua kisser were both strong. I liked the sticky caramel though. The drinks were are about $8.50. Our bill was $40+. I really liked the strawberry creamsicle alcohol drink back at the one in san jose, CA. It has no alcoholic taste, but i guess its vegas, so they hook it up.",1
"This restaurant has really good pizza, though a bit greasy.  The service, however, is really not that great.  The two times I have been there, all guys have been working and they are not very excited about their product.  It is like they are doing me a favor to make a pizza.  I arrived there today at 7:01 pm and they refused to serve me because they were closed and were really quite rude about it.  I didn't argue, but I had driven 20 miles from work to get there so it was disappointing that they couldn't make a single pizza.  I have worked in restaurants; they were going to be there anyway, cleaning up for at least 30-45 minutes.  Obviously they are not interested in customers and I was a relatively new one.  Again, the pizza is great, but do not expect to be impressed with service (although conveniently it pops up to \""""tip\"""" them on the Ipad when you swipe your card.)  Gotta love the audacity of that!",0
This place was great. The manager is super nice and reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place.,1
First let me say the food was great. I had a large group from out of town that wanted to eat downtown and I suggested hash hash a go go. When we went to settle up instead if asking for separate checks(pain in the @$!) I asked the waiter to apply cash a a specific amount on my credit card. He made a mistake and charged my card three times the amount. He fixed it and we left giving him a 20% cash tip. To my surprise the initial charge was taken/held from my bank and when calling the manager Leilani she was not pleasant. I am very patient and she interrupted me and basically said call your bank on Monday and they will release the hold. She gave the obligatory I'm sorry but was rude and said we hold 20% on top of the total regardless.. we left our server cash. If you are going to hire people in a management role hash hash make sure they receive empathy training because this manager was void of it! What if I really needed that money over the weekend? Not returning to this location.,0
"Bring your kids and your sweet tooth !  Great selection except for the make your own sugar stick area.  Most of the powders were out, but my niece made the best out of it \nwith the little selection she had.",1
"First of all the name is misleading... No, \""""Babes\"""" in sight!... Anywhere!!!!  Secondly, if you like 90's headbanging mix blasting in your ear throughout lunch, this is your spot.  Thirdly, the food is an expanded appetizer menu disguised as a lunch/dinner menu - there was not one thing that you have not seen before at a potato skin festival.  The service... The waitress got our order wrong.  Silverware??? You need some, sir?  Atmosphere... Good, but bring your glasses for the tons on mini TV's.\n\nSo, to sum it up - food options were pedestrian, poor and tasted bad... No hot chicks... Super loud headbanger music... The service Suuuucked bad... And finally small TVs.  There is no question why it is failing.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks and go to Sandbar around the corner or Blue32 down Scottsdale road at Indian Bend.  \n\nWould never go back to Babes!!!\n\nPatrick N. above must be an investor, friend or Yelp plant because nobody can get a restauant this wrong out of the gate.",0

"Very refreshing juice spot overall. Close to the LVAC on 215/Flamingo. \nDelicious fresh pressed juices and a few smoothie options. They also provide a 10-15 minute demo with explanations of all their juices and why particular ingredients provide the explosions of flavors in every sip. Polite , well - trained staff and a very clean , classy d\u00e9cor. If you are a health-nut, fitness monster, or somebody just that wants to feel better , you SHOULD definitely check this place out.",1
"My husband and I stayed here 2/17 - 2/20 and had a great time.  The hotel is beautiful -- particularly as it is now decorated for Chinese New Year.  Walking through the lobby, conservatory, or just wandering the halls to window shop or take a peek at the pools was an enjoyable activity in and of itself.  We checked in around midnight, so lines were short and we were in our room in a few minutes.  (Parking was also very convenient.)  The room was beautiful - spacious, clean, nicely decorated.  The bathroom was enormous, with a separate glass-enclosed shower and deep tub.\n\nWe ate at the buffet (great selection for carnivore husband but very limited on vegan options), Sensi (amazing!), Cafe Bellagio (perfect for 3am munchies), and Jean Phillipe Patissiere (my husband indulged and I seriously contemplated giving up veganism).  We also had drinks at the Fortuna Bar overlooking the fountains (amazing!).  Fortuna is a lot of fun, particularly when they have live music there.\n\nGambling there was fun -- he likes slots, I like video poker - and there was plenty of variety to choose from.\n\nA transformer blew while we were there, causing some problems with electricity and the elevators.  We didn't have electricity in our room one night, but offered to move us to another room.  We were lazy and didn't feel like moving and weren't in the room that much anyway, so they ended up taking about $100 of our bill for the inconvenience, which made us pretty happy.\n\nEveryone we interacted with - from front desk staff, to bartenders, to wait staff, to the folks checking room keys by the elevators - were kind, professional, and courteous.  \n\nWhen we go back to Vegas, we won't think about staying any place else.",1
"THIS PLACE IS PROBABLY THE WORST PHO PLACE THAT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO SO FAR....either that or I just got a bad bowl. The prices were average...and sounds about vegas price. I ordered the beef combo (the largest bowl on the menu), the service was fast and the workers were all very kind, so far so good. When the food arrived, it looked amazing. Had my extra side of white onions + lime + chili garlic...I was ready to go to town. A thing that I realized was that the soup was pretty dark....pretty dark brown...never have I had a pho broth that was so dark...but it was fine. The noodles were fine, but the MEAT...was horrible! Im pretty sure that I chewed on the rare beef for about 5 minutes for me to swallow, and the tripe was super chewy as well too. Pretty soon, my jaw got annoyed and tired and just disregarded the meat all together. The broth was good though!\n\nThis venue is probably one of my favorite nightclubs, and the nightclub that I go to most. WHY? Cuz I love house/trance music. Area is very big and very well ventilated as well. The SKYBOX is awesome, as well as the tv screen and light visuals.  If you love electro music, this is def. one of the spots to hit up. Saw Paul Oakenfold, Armin Van Buuren, ATB, Markus Schulz, and some other DJs here as well.\n\nUNTIL THEN!! ^-^",0

"Had baby backs, brisket, and tri-tip. Brisket was awesome; however, baby backs and tri-tip were way below average. Baby backs were too dry and not cooked slow and long enough; thus, bones would not come off easily. Very disappointing as I was looking forward to trying this place out. Tried tri-tip per employee's recommendation but it was way too dry for my liking. I can cook way better than this place in my Green Egg. If you are a fan of brisket, I would recommend this place. Otherwise, I would not go back.",0
"We went to Lavo over the Memorial Day weekend and it was not one of the better experiences I had.  We sat outside on the balcony, which is awesome.  The waiter we had was outstanding and tended to our every need.  The downfall to the evening was the food poisoning I endured while in the restaurant.  We ate dinner and were sitting having some after dinner conversation when I was sick to my stomach.  I apologize to anyone who may have been sitting near me, but it struck me like a brick upside the head.  They asked if it was due to the alcohol I drank, however the first drink I had and the only food I had to eat was at Lavo.

"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE GOTTEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!\n\nSo, I get there. Keep in mind I have only 30 minutes to complete a lunch run for my work. I go in there, and the Hispanic lady was SO RUDE. I stand there for (I looked at my watch) for 11 minutes, there was only 1 customer in the drive thru and she kept on walking past me without acknowledging me. So I finally said, may I take my order? She looked at me with disgust and aggravation, so rude (I can't reiterate this enough) and let me take my order. She ignored me and finally took my order after another SIX MINUTES!!! I bought the YELP discount special, and this made her even more mad, maybe because she had to do math? I don't know! So I ordered my good and paid. I asked for a menu, to double check, because she overcharged me 15 dollars!!! Then after I asked for a receipt........ BUT SHE GAVE ME A RECEIPT STUB! She said just look at the menu and then you can let everyone know. (Everyone at work chipped in for the meal, I didn't want to come back spending more of their flow, oh and btw IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRICES ON THE MENU AND THE AMOUNT I PAID IT DID NOT MATCH UP AT ALL!!!!! I tried to explain to her but she wasn't buying it! I didn't even want to argue because I was already late! If it was my money and food I literally would have just left on the spot!\n\n36 minutes later ( I kid you not ) my food was done 3 burgers and fries. I might as well have gone to a restaurant not a damn food truck...\n\nOhhhh in addition, the inside was FILTHY!! And I guy came in and dropped off some hot dog buns from food for less on the floor! \n\nThe food was alright, however I bit into the burger, I know what comfort and junk food is... But this was like a heart attack waiting to happen. I bite into it and I literally gulped oil and oil dropped everywhere, I must have bitten into an oil pocket or something... Whatever it was alright, the burger. Maybe I was so disgusted with the horrible customer service it made the food nasty as hell. Oh and in addition for this \""""fresh\"""" meal and soggy oily buns, and 90 percent ice lemonade.... The fries were COLD soggy and slightly frozen (fresh? My ass!) In the end, she have me a menu, and said you call me it's better for you before you come so you won't wait so long, with a menu with different prices than the damn menu in the front!\n\nSo what did I get eating at this place.\nNIGHTMARES from the worst customer service of my life (literally I'm about to piss my pants)\n15 dollars OVER with no receipt but a ticket stub with a menu that contradicts the menu in the front --- and coworkers who probably think I stole money from them or gave myself a little 15 dollar tip!  \nAnd a heart attack I'm sure from the overly oily burger\nFrostbite, from the cold ass fries\nDehydration from the 90 percent ice lemonade.",0
"WORST APARTMENT COMPLEX EVER !!!\nI have been here for about 8 months and the longer I am here the more I want to walk away from my lease. The office staff on a normal day has a very bad attitude (who wouldn't though when you have a complex full of unhappy residents... ALTHOUGH IF THEY DID THEIR JOB THEY WOULDNT HAVE THAT ISSUE)\nWhen I did my walk through at my lease signing i needed them to replace ONE light bulb, NEVER GOT DONE. then my living room fan broke, my dining room lights LITERALLY exploded, my kitchen light burnt out my patio light burned out, and 3 of my blinds just fell off. These events all happened over the course of my 8 months and EVERY time a new issue came up I (nievley) put in yet another request, that was NEVER addressed. Earlier this week I found out they had to get a new maintenance supervisor (shocker) and HE WAS THE ONLY ONE who got someone out to me the day I put in a request. I would always go into the office and they would write down my request on there pad and nothing..... turned out THE OFFICE NEVER EVEN PUT IN THE FUCKING REQUET !!!\nthere was only 1 request ever submitted to my chart and that was from may !\nthey had no idea any of these other issues were even going on. \nSo finally the new manager (very nice man, genuinely felt bad) gets someone out to the apt maybe 20 min later and majority of my requests were fixed... the last thing on his list was to replace a pull strong for the light in my living room. The guy takes the lighting fixture off and says he needs to go grab something that he would be right back. I WAITED OVER AN HR before finally I had to leave for work, no one ever came, called, nothing. I go into the office a few days later to complain about the exposed wires I told them i don't even care if its fixed at this point ill buy a lamp I just want the light fixture replaced/ put back so when family gets into town for Christmas I don't have that exposed. Once again they took my information and request wrote it down and NEVER SHOWED UP !\nToday I went into the office to tell them it has been a week and no one has come, now I have family coming into town and need it fixed TODAY before i go to work at 1:30, I was told with in the hr i should have someone there, and I explained that if not I would be back to see where they were since a simple poliet request did not seem to get anything done. OF COURSE no one showed up and I went down there to check and this office lady had the nerve to talk down to me and tell me I need to be patient.... PATIENT WAS FUCKING 8 MONTHS AGO !!!\n\nFINALLY someone shows up and tells me he knows what needs to be fixed and will grab the part he needs and come right back .... THAT WAS AN HR AGO !\nI am so far passed angry right now I don't even know what I need to do to get someone to ACTUALLY do what they say they are going to do\n\n\nI would also like to add that this maintenance issue is only ONE of the many reason I will not be renewing my lease and telling everyone I can never to rent here. \n\n- The model apt is NOTHING like the ones they lease... patchy walls that look like shit is what I got \n- messing up our lease date\n-not having the apt ready on move in day\n- having the carpets cleaned the DAY AFTER move in day ( which put us 2 days with out our apt)\n- never answering the phone in the office ( very annoying)\n- losing packages \n- bad attitudes \n-LIERS",0
Best chicken sandwich and red velvet cake are my favorites. Breakfast is good here too. Not many breakfast choices but they have all the basics.  I would eat here every day but it's a little spendy. Worth the money though.,1
"Started out very good, service was great, ordered food great,  but then they brought our food and my daughter medium well steak was brought RAW. So I give my waiter the plate.  MY daughter is now waiting for her dish. We waited for her dish 15 more min, while we are waiting none of us our eating. She finally gets her food and it was good, but now our food is cold. So we will c what happens! !!!!!! So the waiter still tries to charge me for my full meal. This place was A VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING PLACE. EVEN WORSE WAS THE OWNER Was at the bar socializing and not once ask what the problem was. Left my number on my ticket if he wants to discuss the problem.",0
These Guys make a very good NY style Pizza!   I would recommend this place to anyone that loves NY style Pizza.,1
"Really good food, great condiment bar, and a clean dining area. It's not the fanciest place around, but the food speaks volumes. The menu is reasonably simple and it really has an authentic taste. It's 79 cents extra for handmade tortillas for tacos.",1
"haha only came here once for happy hour, but i am just pleased with the price. i guess coming from ny, anything would be better price wise. $3 for draft and a big selection of beers so good times. also it's right across the theater so it's a good place to go and chill before the movie starts.. which is exactly what i did haha.",1
"Food 4 stars - service 5+ stars\n\nFound this on Yelp on got there right when it opened.  Within 15 minutes the place was packed, we thought....\""""this must be good\"""".  We tried the beef steak calzone with au jus - very tasty.  I tried the Natalie's new pizza (small size) and my BF had a meat pizza.  I wasn't a huge fan of the thin crust - it is more cornmeal than dough but the toppings and flavor profile was delicious.  we also had salad since and tried 2 of their 6 homemade dressings.\n\nThe waitress was fantastic.  She even brought a sample of their vodka marinara and marinara sauces to try and they were incredible.  They were dark red, very condensed, excellent flavor.  They sell the dressings & sauces at the store.  \n\nA good find and we would definitely go back.",1
"My favorite casual local spot! The Korean food is good and inexpensive, with lots of little branch an sides which they will usually refill at some point. The owner recognizes me, and can usually guess my order :) I have never tried any of the Hawaiian food, but the hot stone bibimbap and the spicy seafood soup are both yummy!",1
Came here with my kids to enjoy the evening...the staff is super nice...however we walked out in 30 minutes...due to the fact that it reeked of cigarette smoke...I understand people are entitled to smoke...but I think that an hotel/casino that is family oriented and cater to kids should ban smoking...there is no reason why my kids or other innocent babies be exposed to second hand smoke...someone has to start a change...it should be a heavyweight like Cicus Circus...I would even book a stay here...if smoking was banned...FYI...I WALKED OUT WITH A BAD HEADACHE!,0
"Let me preface this by saying I got the all day buffet for free, and normally it runs $38. And free food always tastes anywhere from 2-2.5x better than food you pay for. \n\nOur first day in Vegas we hit up the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort, so needless to say More at Luxor was a step down...literally because the place is located in the basement of the Luxor. That said, it is easily the best food I've ever eaten inside of a basement. \n\nIf you stick to the normal food here, it's hard to find much to complain about. First we had the breakfast buffet and the sausage, eggs, bacon, and omelette bar were solid and great for filling up to start the day.\n\n There were only two things on the breakfast buffet that were so bad I couldn't swallow a bite: the biscuits and gravy, and the sausage and egg \""""burrito.\"""" I don't know what was inside of that so-called burrito, but it damn sure wasn't anything I would ever use at home. The biscuits and gravy was more bland than disgusting, and after a night of downing straight shots of tequila with no problem, it should say a lot that I didn't have the courage to take more than one bite of their hard biscuit or nasty gravy. \n\nFor dinner, it's pretty much standard Hometown Buffet or Golden Corrall food. Nothing here is going to blow you away like you would find at Wicked Spoon or Studio B, but  there are a few tasty items to be tried. First, the Buffalo Shrimp are pretty amazing. I've never had Buffalo Shrimp but I had to have eaten 2 plates of the shrimp alone. Second, the carved turkey was very good and paired with the mashed potatoes and gravy, I have to say was surprisingly Thanksgiving-like. So definitely some decent food for dinner to be had but there were more than a few duds. \n\nThe pizza - Imagine if Digiorno came out with a new pizza called \""""Flavorless.\"""" That's More's pizza in a nutshell. The crust and texture were Digiorno, but the sauce and everything else tasted like moist paper towels. \n\nThe Chicken - I don't know how you fuck up chicken because it has to be up there with scrambled eggs on the list of \""""The Most Impossible Foods to Ruin\"""" but More manages to do a great job at doing a poor job preparing chicken. Tons of fat, no flavor, gooey texture, etc. It tasted the way I would imagine chewing on a human kidney would be. \n\nSo all in all, More is great if you can get it at a discount and stick to basic foods offered in order to recharge your batteries and get something in your stomach. However, if you're spending the full $26 to get int he buffet, I would suggest the extra $14 at Wicked Spoon or heading down the road to Flamingo's Paradise Buffet for the same price.",0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  The line is ALWAYS crazy long --- but worth the wait!  And while you are waiting, you are inside the casino or the mall, so at least you are not standing outside in the rain/heat. :)  Hands down the best sandwich place in Vegas.",1
"I love the food at Paradise Bakery.  It's fresh, and pretty consistant.  I like the choices they have for kids' meals, and the fact that they come with a yogurt.  The customer service at this location could use a little help.  I have had employees be smart/short/rude with me on most occasions.  Why do I put up with it?  The food is so good!  The salads are amazing, and they're huge.  If my family is really tired,and doesn't want to cook dinner but doesn't want \""""fast\"""" food, this is our go to.  If you go in towards the end of their dinner rush, they are normally out of things.  One or two ingredients for your salad, or to-go containers.  Something.  As previous reviewers have mentioned, the ordering system is a little frustrating.  It's easier to navigate when it's not lunch hour.  This location is bananas from 11am-1pm.  I won't even go at that time anymore.",1
What happened..they got a new chef ...why did they let the old chef go..what a difference in the food..everything was off..by the time we got to the entree we knew something was very wrong..It was our 24 anniversary and we did not even order a dessert because we already knew it would be bad....not at all the same...We have raved to everyone about the chef..I need to know where he went ..cus I am not coming back here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"As a kid growing up in the desert, it represented a few things...an obstacle between me and the carnival to traverse at night with no flashlight and a pant leg full of cholla needles, the place where my dog kept disappearing to, and my single mother's idea of a great family outing consisting of metal detecting and rattlesnake hunting.  \n\nThe desert was the place I would leave and to which I would never return.  In a cruel twist of fate, I'm back.  But as an adult, I've come to appreciate a lot about the deserts.  The best sunsets and lightning shows, plant and wildlife that defies all odds, and relative solitude.\n\nMy husband and I finally decided a proper desert outing was in order and headed to McDowell Mountain Park for a \""""hike.\""""  Check out Norm R's excellent review with all the details about this park.  We opted for the North Trail, an easy 3-mile loop that will not test your endurance and is suitable for all fitness levels.  Much to my husband's dismay, there are benches along the loop.  If I see a bench, my ass will sit on it, whether I need to or not, under the pretense of taking in the scenery.  And there is much to take in here.  As we were out fairly early for this time of year, we only saw two other people and their delightful Rhodesian Ridgebacks on the trail as they jaunted past us.  Otherwise, it was just us, the desert, the birds, the rabbits, and the deer.  Yes, I saw a deer again!  Granted it was not grazing outside my office or jumping over my car, but there it was, a deer, in the middle of the desert.  I was happy to not see a snake or a scorpion which is why January is the perfect time to visit the park.\n\nOn the way out, we stopped at the visitor center and purchased an annual pass for $75 which allows access to all Maricopa County Parks except Lake Pleasant.  I was hesitant with the summers lasting so long, but with the picnic areas and night programs, I'm thinking we can get our money out of this.  I'm just hoping this park stays open!",1
This place has been around for years and has the best Mexican in town. My family and I have been probably been coming here for 30 years!!!!  The MP-1 Green corn tamale rice and beans is very good along with their fajitas. Bomb chips and salsa as well!!!,1
"This was by far the worst experience I've had in a while.\n\nNot only does Tatami boast inventive sushi with a tropical atmosphere, they have a seemingly reliable location in the Old Port of Montreal. What could go wrong?\n\nFirst of all, I'm sure that the sushi chef measures his rolls with a toonie. The rolls are small, mushy and they fall apart upon first contact with chop sticks. When you order, be prepared to get half of your meal. Only when I received my 8 out of 16 pieces was I told that they have run out of such things as avocado and scallop. I had to ask to order something else when the waitress looked at me with a blank stare.\n\nThis brings me to service. You know that charming man with the squeegee  as you get off the Ville Marie? He beats these people ten fold in the service department. Having to ask for a menu, a glass of water and then to order more sushi because I wasn't told in advance that they have run out of \""""fundamentals\"""" is unacceptable and lazy service. Then, to add insult to injury,  the bill took over 20 minutes to settle.\n\nAnd you know those \""""salt water tanks\"""" tables? They are fishless and assume all of the legroom leaving diners to sit sideways.\n\nSometimes, I can forget about terrible service when I'm saturated in a perfect meal- in this case, I'm trying to forget about the whole thing.\n\nGo somewhere else to spend a fortune. This isn't worth it.",0
"This is my favorite place in Vegas! I get the hot n juicy medium for a sauce, and I crave it days after eating. The staff is friendly, the food amazing and interactive. I always take visitors here for a great time! But you smell like garlic all day, so make sure you don't have any important meetings later on. Or even if you do, totally worth it!",1
"Terrible! I had my oil changed here a few times over the last 1.5 years. Each time it took about 40 - 50 minutes including the time for the free wash that comes with it. \n\nWent to have my oil changed recently. I'm the only car there, was quoted 20 minutes by long haired Mike (the wash upseller) who writes up the ticket when you arrive. Windshield vulture immediately swooped in after I spent a solid two minutes declining upsell tactics. Big handshakes, pals, buddies, best friends - NO JUST CHANGE MY OIL PLEASE. Very aggravating way to be greeted and treated.\n\nFast forward 2 hours and I'm still waiting for the oil change to complete, very concerned at this point that something went wrong. Walked outside to see what the story was. Long haired Mike says the tech got oil in his mouth and it's a difficult change to make even though another tech handled it 4 or 5 times prior with no issue at all. \n\nSuspicious, I took the car into a mechanic. Sure enough there's a small leak and clear damage to the oil pan, threads, etc. They most likely spent 1.5 of the 2 hours trying to cover up the damage instead of shooting straight with me and admitting to a mistake. Lots of silicon type substance all over the pan and plug that was used as a seal. Quoted $487.00 for a new oil pan. \n\nTook it back in to Car spa, showed a picture of the damage, asked them to make it right. I'd say they made it 25% right by changing the plug and confirming there was absolutely no leak. Dealer recommendation is still to replace the oil pan. As long as I don't have a leak, I'm leaving it be at this point as I don't have the time nor the patience to deal with the hassle of pushing harder.\n\nTremendous disappointment and ridiculous customer service to an almost comical extent. The place has gradually gone downhill over the past year. Of course, after this past experience, there won't be another. The wash was also never anything special. You've been warned, go elsewhere.",0
"The one star is for the service, not the food.  The food is pretty good, and the steaks are always seasoned and cooked perfectly.  However, service was awful.  Even though the dinner rush had not even hit yet our waiter rarely came by our table.  They FORGOT our appetizer.  They brought out the bread basket late and with only half the bread.  Service was terrible.  Very disappointed since Brio has historically been one of my favorite places.",0
"Having progressive insurance is by far the best insurance to have first and foremost and having a real cool, caring and productive Agent also helps too. So, due to someone side swipping my car while in a parking lot, I ended up here. \n\nThis place has Great customer service, the 2 ladies that helped me were very welcoming and informative on what was to come of my car on both visits.  I dropped off my car on 3/18 and finished on 4/1, the due date, also they had a rent a car awaiting my dropoff.\n\nThe body collision center that fixed my car did a great job on the paint and remodeled of both driver rear panels.",1
"We came here for lunch based on all the rave reviews here on Yelp, and were seated at the bar as we didn't have a reservation. The place was packed to capacity on a Thursday afternoon around 1PM. There was one bartender on duty who was also acting as our server. While cordial enough, she was obviously overwhelmed. After a while she took our orders, and we sat at the bar being bumped up against by fellow patrons and wait staff. After waiting almost 30 minutes for a sandwich and a salad, we ran out of time and asked the bartender to make our order to go. She assured us twice that it would be right out. Another 10 minutes later and the order finally came out. Overall the food was nothing to rave about, and certainly not worth having to wait 40 minutes for. No utensils were included and a side was missing. We certainly didn't get what all the hype was about.",0
"Yummy food and good service... sat in the bar area and got thebar tender as a server and he,was nice   his name was beto ..great job... good food",1
"Sat. Night, we called ahead to see if reservations were required.  The girl on the phone said no, that the wait was only 5  minutes.  We were 5 minutes away, and on our way.  5 minutes later, we arrived. (4 adults, & 1 child). We are now told by that same girl there's a 45-50 minute wait.  We looked around and it didn't seem busy at all.  What changed in the last 5 minutes??No tourists bus just pulled up.  There were only 2 couples at the sushi counter, and just several tables.  The bar was busy, but that's not where we wanted to sit anyway.  And only 1 couple standing in the lobby, who said they didn't understand the wait times either.  They had been standing there for 30 minutes, watching group after group turn around and walk out after being told there wait was going to be long too.  That other couple that was waiting, walked out too.  We ended up having a great meal at another nearby restaurant with no wait at all, Stingray lost out on a lot of business. Horrible guest communications.",0
"Ho-Hum......just another five star review. But really folks, to see true rock stars performing our favorite rock anthems PERFECTLY at a price a whole lot cheaper than any of the cirque shows (or most any other show in Vegas) is UNBELIEVABLE!\nMy only apology is to those who sat around me because I just couldn't keep quiet and sit in my chair for a show like this. I'm 57 but, for two hours, felt 18 all over again.  Just great!\nI'm alrady bugging the wife about our next trip to Vegas just to see these guys again.",1
"I'll NEVER go to either of the Papa Del establishments again.  After paying $50 for two pizzas that I waited almost 1.5hrs to have delivered, I received subpar products (overcooked and poorly made).  To make things worse, when I called to give feedback and ask for some kind of accommodation, I was talked down to by one shift manager Rob and hung up on by another Mark.  After 20 yrs. of patronage, I expected better.  They have lost my business forever and I'll be sure to let the owner Bob know exactly why!",0
My first visit tonight will be my last. Took over an hour to get a table that had been promised to be ready at 8 PM when we called to confirm at 7:30 PM for a party of 12. We didn't get seated until more than an hour passed and when seated no one came over to take drink orders. I had to go find someone for a waitress. The food took more than 30 minutes to arrive and by now it's past 9:30 PM and half the restaurant is empty. The manager came to table to apologize for the amateur service and she said she'd comp some meals or at least parts of the meals. NO SUCH COMPS WERE GIVEN and an 18% gratuity was added to all checks. I've visited many restaurants in Charlotte in 24 years of living here but this is among the top 10 worst experiences I've ever had. My impression is that no one on the staff really cared what happened to us and the manager's attitude pretty much cemented that view.,0
"I've stayed here twice and the first time wasn't so bad.  I wasn't expecting much for the price, but we didn't run into any problems because we were staying in the newly remodeled north tower.  The second time, we arrived at 2am due to a chemical spill on the freeway that turned our 4 hour drive into an 8 hour drive.  When we got there, we had to stand in a huge line and right before our turn the clerk let a lady cut in front of us because she was having a problem with our room...Okay, but I just wanted to get to our room!  Turns out that this lady wanted a new room because the toilet was broken so they switched her rooms.  When we were finally helped, I was told that the King size non-smoking room that I reserved was no longer available and that all she had left was a king size smoking or a double queen non smoking...Yeah because they had just given our room away to the other lady!  But, being so tired, I was in no room to argue so I just went with the double queen non-smoking...It must have been the room that the other lady had just turned in.  When we got there, first of all you could hear the entire freemont street experience from the bathroom every hour.  It was so loud!  There were NO TOWELS, The bathroom floor was soaking wet and there was hair on it, disgusting!  And the carpet near the bathroom was soaking wet too.  But, being that it was so late, all the other hotels were booked and that we literally only needed to sleep for a couple hours, my boyfriend wiped up the water with a bathmat and we went to sleep. A few hours later, we were awoken by a god awful \""""Bloop\"""" noise every few minutes.  The toilet was making bubbles and that's where the water was coming from.  There was toilet water all over the tile and carpet, so gross.  I couldn't even pee because I was afraid to sit on the toilet in fear that I might bubble while I was on it!  The only good thing that I have to say about this place is that they gave us our money back.  So ghetto.",0
Overrated.  Is the al pastor and asada delicious? Yes.  Is it waaay over priced? Yes.  The chips were cold and not very tasty.  The salsas were not memorable.  The corn tortillas they use for the tacos are not half as good as the ones Food City or Ranch Market makes.  They do have a nice selection of beers.  I guess they do so well because their patrons love Mexican food and will pay more to have it served by Non-Mexicans.  I guess if you've never had the real deal before this place is good.  There are many many Mexican restaurants in Phoenix serving much better tacos and burritos for half as much.  I won't be back.,0
"Went for Sunday brunch, I must point out that this was my breakfast companions choice, as I preferred the tried and true border grille.\nIn any case, have heard good things about this place so was open to try.\n\nIt was a nice, well lit dining area, and we were seated promptly.\nthe layout looked ok, so we opted for their breakfast \""""buffet\"""" at 40/each\n\nI have to say that the menu items sounded like a great way to start the day, but I think that is where it ended....unfortunately.\n\nwe placed a \""""kitchen\"""" order for the huervos rancheros, white trash fried chicken, and their signature frosted flake French toast....\n\nin the meantime, we went to the counter to start with a grilled ham/cheese Panini and a bleu cheese/fig baguette......YUCK, would have been happier with a cold bologna sandwich. The baguette was just so-so, but the Panini on pretzel bread....horrible\n\nstrike 1.....\n\ngot a couple items from the sweet section, including what appeared to be a pistachio macaroon, some caramel corn in a Chinese take out box, and the waiter brought us some pink cotton candy.  The candy corn was at least edible, but the green macaroon was actually mint flavor???? what an awful mouthful that was.  The cotton candy looked nice, but was not good in the least, so we left it as table d\u00e9cor....\n\nstrike 2....\n\nkitchen items arrived, we were looking forward to having something to eat....\nthe item of the day, the huervos rancheros was pretty bland, almost as if the cook had used no seasoning at all....basically very mild salsa on top of a crispy corn tortilla with an overdone egg on top....bit of black beans and pork sprinkled on plate too....should have passed on this.....\nhave to at least say the chicken was edible, and had some flavor. presented with an egg on top which was nice, and some spicy sauce on bottom\nthe French toast came out on the cold side, so maybe that would explain the bland texture and taste? was a bit overdone too....I prefer mine a lighter shade of brown and not the color of my coffee.....\n\nstrike 3\n\n......well that is 3 strikes, and we did decide to suffer a bit more and at least try a crepe....bad decision. we had the grilled vegetable and swiss cheese one, and watched as the cook took a crepe off a stack of premade ones and threw on induction pan to heat up, throwing the vegetables and cheese on top to warm.\nAWFUL....for the price we paid, would it really have been out of line to expect them to make a crepe to order???? it's not the hardest thing to do now\n\nstrike 4????\n\nso aside from the 1 edible kitchen dish (chicken) and the candy corn, we both did enjoy their coffee. the orange juice was good too, although it was so busy (HAHA) that we had to ask the waiter more than once for 1 simple glass\n\nOne other thing that bothered me more than my companion was the fact that the waiter seemed to not really give a sh*t at all. My friend is a server at another venue and says it wasn't his fault the food was so bad which I do understand. but when he picks up every plate and it is very apparent we did not eat anything at all, an apology or something would have been nice...to show he at least cared?\nwell I guess you can only take negative comments so long before you become numb to the job.....\n\nI hope they take these comments to heart and try to implement some changes.  It is pretty hard to justify those prices for a simple brunch menu with low quality. The setting and atmosphere made me want to like this place, but the food and service makes a return visit so NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!!!!",0
"I've been to this location multiple times because it is near my house and it's always been okay. Tonight completely left a sour taste in my mouth that wasn't from my mediocre burrito.\nWhen my friend and I (who also works with me) arrived, the staff looked extremely unhappy and exhausted. My friend tried to make small talk with the girl who warms the tortillas and she was so exhausted and mentioned it had been busier than normal when my friend asked which is understandable. the girl who was working the line seemed upset as well. it was then I noticed the cashier, Jalon (whose name was on the receipt, which is really convenient when the employees don't wear name tags) was berating the girl working the line for a mistake she had made and for not being further on the pre closing checklist. my friend said to cut her some slack and I interjected that as a manager in my job, I've never treated my employees with such disrespect. she immediately responded that that was her friend and continued to berate the girl. Jalon rang me up incorrectly and when I corrected the order she yelled at the girl working the line and said loudly to me \""""and see you were trying to defend her!\"""". it was such an uncomfortable situation and I noticed she continued to be rude and abrasive.\n\nthis is pretty unacceptable for a place of business and I will be contacting this store directly to inform them of how their employees are being treated. \n\nno wonder everyone working looked like they'd rather get hit by a bus than be working the line with such a rude person.",0
"They forgot my order, I waited 25 minutes for my bubble tea. The worst attitude I have ever experienced.",0
"Not since Casey at the Bat struck out has been there so little joy in Mudville with a particular outfit. I say that because this restaurant's inauthentic name seems to speak volumes: RAW Organic Food+Juices. Well, first off, the food I've had here is NOT organic food. It's not. Now I'm not religious with organic food, but I've had enough of it over the years to know the difference between Nature's greatest glory and its pesticide-laden counterpart. \n\nSecondly, the rain came and washed away all my dreams because there is a complete and total lack of \""""RAW\"""" food cuisine, despite the all-caps portion of the venue name. Meaning, there is no \""""raw food\"""" per se. Oh, I'll grant you that there are some RAW ingredients in some menu items, here and there. Yes, even McDonald's and Burger King can make that claim, but does that mean they ought to change their name to \""""RAW Organic Food\"""" as well? Methinks not. \n\nSo yeah, there's some lettuce, some vegetables, and there's even some pretty fine guacamole found in some menu items. But the name, \""""RAW Organic Food\"""" implies there is RAW food cuisine; i.e., creative concoctions consistently of purely UNCOOKED foodstuffs, which are all the rage with health-minded foodies in Southern California and points beyond. Unfortunately, at this venue, there isn't a single menu item that is entirely RAW. Not one. (Probably because much of \""""raw\"""" cuisine - particularly the liberal use of nuts in many recipes - isn't exactly dirt cheap on the budget.) I can't help but think that this was their strategy here: We'll call it \""""raw\"""" and \""""organic,\"""" but we'll use ultra-low-grade ingredients (such as lentils instead of nuts) that have cut-rate prices, as low as Christmas trees the day AFTER Christmas; and like a silver-tongued snake oil salesman, we'll sell it all as high-quality \""""health\"""" food - laughing all the way to the bank in the process!  And us good little lemmings/customers walked right into their phony \""""health\"""" food ambush; like Custer at the Little Big Horn, which didn't turn out so well for him. \n\nJust know that when your name itself is false advertising, and your business practices are in line with that methodology, you're following directly in the footsteps of P.T. Barnum himself. But hey, let's face it, this location is smack dab in THE local hotbed of people with heavenly bodies and head-turning faces that would put Helen of Troy to shame; and, I suspect, the name of the restaurant is taking full advantage of its location to lure in that type of crowd with the \""""RAW Organic food\"""" motif. So, I ask you, why not have something, ANYTHING(!) on the menu, that would reflect the name, other than non-Organic juices?  P.T. Barnum said it well: There's a sucker born every minute. And this place is in very good standing with his quick-buck-artist mentality. \n\nThough, by most accounts, the food here is decent, even if it's not actually \""""raw\"""" nor \""""organic.\"""" And I would mostly concur with that from my experience. (Though, just imagine how delish it would be if they actually stuck to their name!) I'm of the mind that you can't go wrong with many of the RAW ingredients actually found here (even when you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with ultra-cheapo ingredients like this place), and I haven't been disappointed with the taste of the food, other than from the sour taste it leaves me from it being neither \""""raw\"""" nor \""""organic,\"""" as advertised. So my main concern with this place, and the reason for my lowly 2-star rating, is the integrity issue.  Honest Abe said it best himself, \""""You can't fool all of the people all of the time.\"""" (I'm also not the only one here on Yelp saying these things about this place, including the very first review.) And the fact is that the apple, no matter how you slice it, does not fall far from the tree - all in a dishonest day's work.\n\nOverall, I'm giving this place an extra star for having more veggies than McDonald's, but seriously, the name has to go. And honestly, this is NORTH SCOTTSDALE! We don't go here expecting to get McDonald's with vegetables, and we're willing to spend more than you typically would at McDonald's. Ultimately, this venue's big cost-cutting strategy, and the willingness to sacrifice health under the guise of it, is a big turnoff to me. Try making an honest buck and you'll see it feels better. A lot better. \n\nA quiet conscience sleeps in thunder.\n\n6/1/2014 REBUTTAL TO OWNER: 1)You're not actually \""""RAW\"""" if you don't have any RAW food cuisine on your menu. This is beyond dispute. (If, e.g., using cheapskate lentils and cooking them into oblivion, instead having real RAW food, makes you \""""honest\"""" about RAW, then what is \""""dishonesty\""""?) 2)Send me a list of your current suppliers and I guarantee I'll contact them and that I'll positively confirm your \""""organic\"""" status in a revised review. I'll also be contacting them periodically and updating my review here, as necessary, to ensure you really are \""""honest.\"""" This would be a win-win for everyone.",0
"Is there really anything not to love about DCR? This is by far my #1 fav bar in the Vegas area.\n\n1. It can be a little hard to get into. And that is simply because of the entrance door. It is hilarious to sit inside and look out and watch people fumble around trying to find the entrance.\n\n2. The bartenders are actually very knowledgeable about the drinks.\n\n3. The menu rotates seasonally - and each season I find a new favorite cocktail. And more often than not, it is something I never would have normally thought of or tried.\n\n4. The layout of the menu is awesome. It gives you the name of the concoction, the type of glass it is served in, and a brief flavor profile. It does not tell you what is actually in the drink. Major appreciation points for this.\n\n5. The tourists have yet to really discover this place. In fact, I don't think I've ever encountered a tourist in here ever.\n\n6. It's a great after-work hangout. Few patrons, no loud music, and it's pretty much all locals that work in the downtown area.\n\n7. On weekend nights, it can get pretty busy and there is a DJ.\n\n8. Skip the \""""food\"""" menu. It's all awful - I don't know why they even bothered adding these \""""food\"""" options to their menu. However, the various nuts ARE quite good and I highly recommend them.\n\n9. You've got to go to the bathroom here. It completely freaked me out the first time. The stalls are glass. And you can see out, but others can't see in.\n\n10. Did I mention the cocktails? Seriously amazing cocktails. It WILL be the best cocktail you've ever had.",1
"After reading such great reviews from you awesome yelpers, I knew I had to give this place a try. I looked at their menu and got so excited that I had to go that day. So I went to have a quick dinner with my bf last night around 9:30pm.\n\nIt wasn't too smokey or smelly inside, and it was a nice quiet day. We decided on the rockafeller oysters (6 per order) and they were delicious! Though the oysters were  bit small and it seemed there was way too much spinach for the amount of oyster, it somehow worked out! Great flavor.\n\nAnd then we shared the ribs and shrimp combo. The ribs were great! Cooked perfectly and the sauce was yummy, it was a bit too saucy for me, but super yummy. And since I am a low-carber, I asked to sub the fries and slaw for a side salad. (Very fresh veggies). And we chose the garlic shrimp which was also delectable.\n\nI must say, though, the server was a bit slow. He was the only one working the night shift and I guess he was tired, but there was only us and one other table...\n\nI am going back Tuesday to try more yumminess. I will post pictures of the items I get! I'm excited to try their other stuff like the lobster fingers and clam bake and crab (which they ran out of when I was there)...\n\nI highly recommend this place. I will probably make it a regular place to be.",1
"= = = =  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT PIZZA SPECIAL!  = = = =\n\nRobyn N., Mike C. & I whipped in here today for the Lunch Special, which gives you unlimited pizza, salad & drinks.\n\nTechnically this isn't a Buffet, as they bring it all right to you, but was this place ever awesome!!  To start with, it's real nice inside.  Then we got seated & the service was absolutely 5 Stars throughout our visit.  Drinks showed up right away, & then it was on to a choice of a regular or Caesar salad, & I went with the regular one, which was delicious!  Also early on, some really tasty \""""bread sticks\"""" came out, which really amounted to a really tasty cheese pizza cut into strips, with Pizza Sauce for dipping.\n\nFor pizza, you order your choice of many personal size pizzas.  We each ordered different ones & swapped some slices.\n\nThe pizzas, all of them, were TERRIFIC!  On top of that, we were fully encouraged to order more & order more we did!  We were also offered more salads if we wished, & the drinks were kept topped off too.  Oh what a feast!\n\n... And the price for this extravaganza?  An AMAZING $7.99 per person!!  Yes, this place is ABSOLUTELY \""""AS GOOD AS IT GETS!!\""""  YUM-A-MUNDO!!     :-))",1
"Poor old Dynamic Earth, I really can't understand why there are so many bad reviews about it! The first time I visited this place was on a Primary 7 class trip when it first opened. That was a while back now but I absolutely loved it, especially the earthquake, the huge ice berg and the rainforest. After all this time, it's still been a place that's always stood out in my memory and it was definitely one of my favourite trips ever. I was a little shocked then, to find so many low star reviews about it when I looked it up on Yelp. Perhaps it had changed since the last time I was there? So I decided to give it another visit to see what's gone awry. \n\nAfter my second visit to Our Dynamic Earth a few weeks ago, I'm still confused as to why it has so many bad reviews. It's still awesome! Okay, it was better when I was younger but it is designed for children so you can't really fault it just because you've grown up and have lost most of your imagination and childhood spirit. \n\nRather than just strolling around at your own pace, it's designed as a tour where you are transported back to the beginning of time. You are then taken all over the world to experience all the different climates, the ice-berg is still my favourite. You even get to go on a plane, well, a 3D cinema with a flight film. In fact, I think it might be 4D as there's even snow, wind and heat too.Very cool.\n\nDefinitely one for the kids, but if you still have any imagination at all then this place is great and even if you're too grown up for the tour, the planetarium at the end is beautiful so there's something for everyone to enjoy.",1
"We arrived for a convention and were \""""upgraded\"""" by Rose to the Bungalows(a complete misnomer, closer to the casino, but, definitely not bungalows).   But, we were told that it was an upgrade so, we were pleased.  The rooms were fine, nothing spectacular, but fine.\n\nUntil we returned to our rooms later in the evening and they were sweltering.  (It was February, and it was unseasonably warm.)  I have MS, and heat totally exacerbates symptoms.  We called and asked how to turn on the A/C (thinking that we had already done so before we went out for the evening).  We were told that the A/C was not working, and that there were no available rooms.   Miraculously, the next morning at 9 they had a lovely room in the tower.  Great views from here, except they have these weird screen like things tht make you feel a little like you're in prison.  And it wasn't there the night before, but it was all set and ready to move into at 9 the next morning?  Right.\n\nSo-so rooms and dreadful customer service.\n\nAnd,yes, I could make this an ADA issue, but, while I have MS, unless I am over heated, I am disables by it at all.",0
"The food was pretty good. I recommend the Mac and cheese and the chicken nachos. Everything else was terrible. We had a 9:30 reservation for dinner and the music was at club level--we were told it becomes a club at that time of night. I literally couldn't hear the person sitting next to me at the table, even wen shouting.  Very slow service even though it wasn't busy. I probably would have given it 2 stars but the bill came and they had added an 18% (that's fine) plus a \""""service charge\"""" on top of that. Management insisted this was normal business practice in Vegas. I call it fraud.",0
"Great little caf\u00e9! Very cute set-up, good (and affordable!!) coffee, and the sandwiches are delicious. Too bad I never pass by to enjoy another one!",1
Awesome burgers.,1
"Ordered a beef and cheese burrito ( once the waitress decided it was time to saunter over) for my son- he got an all beef burrito and an eye roll from the expediter when I asked for a side of cheese. The carnitas ( bland) were to come with guacamole; no one mentioned they were out of avocado, and I only found out after I received my meal without it and over-hearing another table ask where Their's was. Had to ask for refills- from the expediter ( really another waiter who had to take up the slack). Really, really disappointing.",0
"A long time (four months) ago, before I moved to Phoenix, I would drive up I-17 and wonder what the ugly building on my left was.  Little did I know that it would be one of my go-to spots for a quick lunch!\n\nI've always appreciated  the no frills simplicity of Souper Salad and this particular location is no exception.  The salad bar has always been fresh for me, the rotating soup selection is quite good and the bread is tasty.  Heck, even the pizza is decent.\n\nWhat really makes Souper Salad shine for me are the deals!  Tuesdays are two for one and there are almost always coupons for similar deals.  I can't remember the last time I paid full price.\n\nIt's not fancy and it's not pretty, but the food and pricing are good.  I'll keep going to Souper Salad as long as I work in the area.",1
"Who would think that a fusion of Mexican and Korean would work?  Well, it does.  It was fun to check out all of the different options.  The prices are low and the flavor was high...great combo.  I tried four different things, all of which I enjoyed, but the Kim Chee fried rice was my favorite.  \n\nThe restaurant was a hole in the wall, but I guess it will keep the prices down if the rent is low.  \n\nI would have liked to see a soda fountain, but not too big a deal.",1
When it comes to buffets I think this is the best in Vegas! I will definitely be back for the dinner buffet next time!,1
"Cheap drinks, friendly bartenders, walking distance from the mall and strip... That's like the trifecta of my \""""gettin' slizzard\"""" checklist. I come here for one reason only - to drink copious amounts of alcohol after putting in a solid days work... They occasionally hook it up with the free drinks once you start your routine. Plop yourself down at the bar, play some video poker and warm up that buzz fool.\n\nFree from tourists and troublemakers, this place is frequented by the true locals of Vegas. Most of the people I stir up a convo with all work on the strip or at one of the nearby establishments. Great place to unwind after work for sure (they're open 24 hours a day).\n\nI'm still meaning to try that Chinese joint next door... Eventually I'll tear myself away from the bar... after one more Jack and Ginger.",1
Had major surgery and been without most of my prescriptions for 4 days including my blood clot medication and my Pain pills. Terrible service. Picking up my prescriptions today and going to CVS.,0
"Half of everything was ok, the other half more on the so so side.   We arrived at 10:45 which was between the lunch and breakfast time.    They had a line forming with no one to explain that they would not be seating anyone until 11:00.   That was a bit of a turn off.    Also, a crepe bar where the woman has never heard of a crepe suzette???   The service was ok.",0
Great cozy place for an authentic Italian meal.  Very attentive staff to complement the food.  Try the salmon with one of their reasonably priced glasses of wine.,1
"Seriously a bunch of jerks! Bought a table for $800 and they sat us outside on a tiny picnic table. Then after we were seated they proceeded to take a chair away from one of already seated and give us a foot stool to sit on. What a classless, trashy, bitchy club. Never, ever waste your time or money on the snotty hostess and lame managers.",0
"I experienced European Wax Center today in Chandler and unfortunately, have to say it was the WORSE experience of my  life.  I believe the girl's name was Sarah that did my Brazilian wax and I have to say, it was the most awkward & impersonal waxing service I have ever had.  I have been getting waxed for a long time and when I came across European Wax center, I thought it had a great location and great reviews which intrigued me on giving the place a try. Never again !!  As I sat in the waiting room and was called my name, the waxing specialist didn't smile, say hello, ask how my day was, nothing!  She acted as if she hated being at work.  Then it gets worse.  During the procedure I'm used to the specialist engaging in a conversation, not this woman.  She wanted nothing to do with having a conversation, a laugh, a smile, nothing.  She was far too involved in ripping my hair off and causing me the most extreme pain I have ever felt.  Again, I have had plenty of Brazilian waxes done before and never, have I  experienced the ripping of which this woman did.  Again, this is just my experience however, please be very careful as what I experienced is not normal and I will not be back.",0
"We sat there and watched 3 people have 3 turns singing while we got looked over every time even after the crowd loved our first songs even to the point of standing in front of our table singing along and high five - so I guess u can't go here and be over 40 because if so, the karaoke host will ignore u like u don't exist",0
"We've had so many red flags after 6 months of prenatal care we're switching to another group before we give birth and something REALLY wrong occurs.  \nThe nurses are RUDE - I've interacted with 6 of them, four were just awful!  One nurse (in her mid-50s) actually forgot to turn the fetal heart rate monitor on and said, \""""That's funny, I don't hear a thing\"""".  OMG, what  moron!  I had to tell her to turn on the machine. \nAnother nurse recently told me I've gained too much weight - I've gained 23 lbs and I'm 31 weeks pregnant! ??? She later came back and indicated she was incorrect, but why would she say that??? \nOur OB is nice, but she's transferring out of the group soon.  \nThere seems to be a lot of drama, I really DO NOT recommend going there.",0
Havent been to a robertos in 5 yrs so i was excited to try but to my disappointment it was not as great as it used to be . The asada fries were small for the price and not as tasty as other restaurants. I suggest you try Don Tortaco they have the best asada fries double portion for $1 less.,0
"Stopped here because all the good reviews it had. I got the orange chicken lunch special with a side of stuffed jalape\u00f1os. First of all this is the definition of a hole in the wall restaurant, it seams as it is behind a circle k. Not too sure what the rice was supposed to be, fried rice or brown rice too plain and no flavor. The orange chicken wasn't the greatest I've ever had. Stuffed Jalape\u00f1o where good, descent. Egg roll served with meal had way too much black pepper. The place itself doesn't look too clean, no restroom and they charge for extra hot sauce? Not too sure what everyone else has been raving about. I would think because it's a lunch special is a lower quality but should the restaurant be consistent?",0
Outback food is fairly consistent.... Not bad for a Sunday night takeout....however they consistently FAIL to give us everything we order.  This was our last takeout night from them....  Shame....matching what's in the bag doesn't seem to be that difficult to me.,0
"Really enjoyed walking through Union today.  It was like a mini Chelsea Market in NYC all based on local vendors.  Found a couple bottles of wine and chocolate at Oil & Olive...lucky for us there were free samples to dig into.  Also was able to find a baby shower gift over at White House Flowers.\n\nIt's total proof that Local is powerful.  An absolute pleasure to peruse the 18 shops with such variety from bicycles, candles, flowers, pillows, clocks, magazines, and a dandy restaurant to boot.\n\nWill definitely be back and will be marvelous for unique Christmas shopping",1
"Best thing about eating lunch here is the patio seating. Special soft shell crab over mixed green salad was disapponting at best. Soft shell crab was over-battered and lacked crab flavor. Salad was dull and lime vingrette seemed to be missing the lime. Chopped red onion totally overpowered. On prior visits, sweet potatoe fries are decent.",0
"From the airport, you don't have much choice in which cab you get into, taxi stand directs you and you are stuck with the can that shows up.\n\nOur driver was friendly, as he took the double-secret double-long way to our hotel. Complaint filed with the taxi bureau. Hope the extra $12 he got from us is worth the day he'll have to spend there explaining.\n\n$3 fee to use a credit card, with no advance warning on the machine. Nice. \n\nWon't be using them again if possible.",0
"Hey Gabi M. wish we could agree. On our recent visit there, it became such a comedy of errors that they actually comp'd the entire meal.\n\nA+ for design and architecture, nobody appreciates a fine terrazzo in the bathroom like we do, but D+ for food and service. \n\nHaving said that, it is Hillstone (Houston's) and the one thing they are best known for is their impeccable consistency. \n\nWe are more than confident that they will pull it together in short order and continue to succeed in their real business -- printing money.",0
I went back and tried something I wouldn't normally get on the menu (Turkey Burger).  I must say it is the tastiest turkey burger I've had to date!  I look forward to trying other items on the menu now that I've gotten more direction from fellow Yelpers!,1
"I would rate this place a 4.5. It takes a lot to get 5 stars in my opinion. This place had a great ambiance, the layout is wonderful. We had a party of 6 and got to sit in the \""""cove\"""" area. I ate the lamb chop which was cooked to perfect but I didn't love the potatoes. For dessert I had the hazelnut brownie, I believe it was called, and it was delicious. I would recommend sharing because it was SO rich. I would recommend to a friend and return again.",1
"8 oozing reasons you should get your hiny to Fromagination:\n\n-cheese samples\n-located adorably on the square\n-friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff\n-cheese case with labels that describe the queso in Layman's Terms\n-accoutrements like raw honey, fig jam and truffle vinaigrette are loaded on the shelves (great spot to make a gift basket)\n-gorgeous atmosphere with French cheese signs and a long wooden table\n-grilled cheese of the month\n-and my favorite part: the left over bin with small hunks of great cheese for attractive prices",1
"Sometimes you just gotta have Mexican food.  On my way back to Phoenix from Vegas I consulted Yelp and found this place.  Nice, friendly service and good food.\n\nI had the tricolor enchilada plate and it was delicious. Chicken, beef, cheese with rice and beans.  Good chips and salsa as well.",1
"Wow!! That food was incredible! With every sandwich not only do you get your choice of fries or fruit but you also get soup with it and it was great!\n\nAtmosphere is good, they have a great patio that's large and perfect to sit outside when our weather isn't so hot. Service was very slow but food made it worth it. Deff going back!",1
"I have eaten the wings here a few times, and they are big and meaty. I have to take them home and add some extra heat for my taste. This week I decided to try the Pizza. It tasted good down, but about 2 hours after eating 2 slices of the carnivore pizza I got the chills, and body aches. I didn't associate it with the pizza, until the 2nd day when I had 2 more pieces, and again 2 hours later I was sick. My wife had the popeye and said she never wants it again after the first night due to the horrible gas she got from it. The rest went to the trash.",0
I love this place so far! I went to get my lips corrected after another place had turned them into big lumpy fish lips and Jessica was great! She used hyaluronidase to basically dissolve all the lumps they look amazing. I definitely reccomend this place and will go back!,1
"It's Jimmy Johns. Get in, get your sandwiches freaky fast, don't forget to order a pickle, look at the cool signs, eat it, and then beat it. \n\nThe staff at this location knows how to smile and is friendly...and the food is consistently good. And the fountain drinks are mixed properly and don't suck. What more do you need?",1
"Food is awesome especially the way they cook it over an open fire.  Everything is tender and melts in your mouth.  I had sushi rolls, veggie's on kebab and blacked cod which was the best part.  The presentation and sauces were phenomenal.  This is the first place I actually had a good high end sake that I took my time drinking it was so good.  I will definitely return many times.",1
"Sotto has potential. I haven't been in the building since it was Bullfeathers, and they've definitely cleaned it up. There's a lot of room for dancing, the bartenders are nice, and the vibe overall was really friendly. Why not three stars instead of two?\n- Bottom of the barrel drinks - my whiskey and seven gave me immediate gut-rot. \n- Really young clientele (which is fine/expected, but the owner had previously said in an interview they wanted to cater to an older crowd and everything about the place skews very young). \n- Really mediocre DJ. \n- The fact that when my friends requested \""""My Chick Bad\"""" by Ludacris (they just learned a dance to it at Dance Fabulous heeeeeeeyyyyyyy) the DJ replied, \""""That's too ghetto, I'll have to make a mashup because we don't want any trouble.\"""" Incredible.\n\nGet a better/less vaguely-racist DJ (whoever was spinning on 10/21) and I'll reconsider you, Sotto.",0
"I'd been wanting to go to Talavera ever since I fell in love with a scallop they served at West of Western (pre-Devoured) and, finally, seized the opportunity with Restaurant Week.\n\nMost definitely it's a 5 star setting: the view, the decor, the live music on the patio.\n\nI would give the food a solid 3.5 stars. Based on the restaurant week menu, I enjoyed a scallop (that's what I came for, after all!) which was as good as I remembered, complimented by rich, meaty bits of short rib and diced potato. \n\nMy main course was the pork tenderloin: a more than generous portion of pork cooked medium. The description said it would be served with acorn squash, fall greens and queen creek fig balsamic. The balsamic was merely a plate garnish and did nothing for the flavor profile (which I found disappointing, as I was really looking forward to it) and the squash sure tasted more like potato than squash. \n\nI finished with the Madagascar vanilla flambrulee. The shallow dish was delivered and the sugar crystals brought to flame right at my place. Very dramatic. The other desserts were only even more amazing! A cheesecake served between two pieces of brioche to look like a slider paired with \""""fries\"""" made of funnelcake and a raspberry coulis \""""ketchup,\"""" stealing the show.\n\nHands down, this place hits desserts out of the park! \n\nThe idea of coming here for dessert in a romantic setting is easy to conceptualize! I would give 5 stars for dessert alone. \n\nUnfortunately, service, while cheerful and courteous, was slow. Particularly in the beginning when it took at least 15 minutes for menus and water to be brought to the table -- and that was after a request that someone be notified (aka reminded) that we had been seated. \n\nThe restaurant week menu looked like an eye exam - confusing and very difficult to read.\n\nThe drink prices were probably the biggest deterrent. $16 glasses of wine or margaritas just made me think of other places I could enjoy a meal as good, if not better, and either bring my own or pay less. Not to mention, phenomenal crafted cocktails prepared by \""""celebrity\"""" mixologists found closer to home! (Don't even get me started on the $6 iced tea!)\n\nWe wound up with a $68 bottle with little or no encouragement from our server, despite the fact that they were supposedly offering a summer 'Wine Down' program with 35 wines that are discounted at 35% off. I didn't notice any mention of that at the time.\n\nIf I ever give up drinking, maybe I'll come back. Otherwise, my Talavera experience may have been a one night stand...",0
Very good food and and unique presentation. You can actually pick out your fish and they will cook it at the table. That was cool and it tasted lovely. A must try if your in the area. Will be back again soon!!,1
I have never been treated worse at a club in my life. The bouncers inside the club were so incredibly offensive that I left at 12:15.,0
This is probably the best quick Greek food in Las Vegas.  They also do the food at the annual Greek festival.  I love the gyro and rice.  The baklava is quite good as well.  The service is good and so are the prices.  :-),1
"Not to give away my beauty secrets or anything... but I drive all the way from Los Angeles - the skincare capital of the world - to go to the Skin Institute in Vegas.\n\nEveryone at The Skin Institute is super-pro and appear to come from the heart of truly wanting you to tap into your natural beauty and maintain healthy skin. They never try and up-sell you like so many irritating places in LA. And they remember you - even asking after me to my friend who lives in Vegas that recommended their services a couple of years ago.\n\nThe staff is incredibly nice, informed and chill. I know, I know, it's Vegas - but this place has more of a Northern California vibe. The interiors are very tastefully done - a perfect balance of \""""medi\"""" and \""""zen.\""""\n\nI highly recommend their services and even better, the pricing is far less than Southern California.",1
"I was going to let this restaurant go but then I saw all of the favorable reviews and I just had to put my two cents in.  This place absolutely does not live up to the hype in any way.  I made my birthday reservations at 7.30 so we could make the 10pm Cirque show.  We were seated right away, had our drink orders taken and promptly served and then we didn't see our server again for 15 mins.  My friends and I decided to go with the tasting menu which was simple enough.  The salad was more boring than anything that I've made out of my own refrigerator.  I was looking forward to trying the salmon over the english pea puree but that came out so salty I had to down my glass of water.  (which didn't get refilled for another 10 minutes).  My dessert order was wrong so that took time that we didn't have to correct.  And then by the time we were able to flag down our schoomzy (with every other table) server, we only had 10 minutes to book it to the theatre.  Really?  Almost 2.5 hrs to get through an completely unsatisfying dinner.  Boo.",0
"This place is good, and for how good pretty damn affordable.",1
Yolos was very disappointing.  The chicken fajitas were the blandest I've ever had.  Guacamole was tasty though.,0
"This place....Oh My.....\nWell if you're a vegetarian...RUN. \nI got stuck at this place due to a corporate event my company hosted there. \nLet me say, how excited I was at the idea of Mexican food at the Christmas party. Then my vegetarian instinct kicked in when I got there....hmm....lets check for lard.\nI asked the waitress who was going around...slowly I add but it was a busy night so maybe the service is faster when there isn't a huge event going on. (I'm thinking understaffed?....hoping?) Anyway, I was then informed that they cook their beans with bacon. What? Yes. Bacon. So there went the idea of a burrito, a tostada. Depressing. I ended up eating the very \""""ehh\"""" chips (deep fried tasting and thicker than the typical chip. I'd venture to guess possibly flour chips?) \nI'm not a big drinker so the allure isn't there for the bar aspect. \nI will honestly never be back and from what the people who actually did eat there said I didn't miss anything.",0
"Got a coupon for $10 off an oil change and $15 for a smog check.  Went in and they took me right away.  They honored both coupons and the total was $48 out the door.  The gentleman who assisted me was very friendly (blue shirt, glasses - sorry didn't get his name) and provided great service. Was in and out in 15 minutes with an oil change and smog check - painless.  I'll definitely go back again (with a coupon of course).  Great service! Thanks guys.",1
Great Salon the staff was great along with the price! Recommend it everyone..,1
"Since relocating offices from our midtown branch to our downtown branch, not only have I experienced a dramatic decrease in stress (begone, Dragon Lady!!), but I've also been able to expand my lunch dining portfolio. One that I was eager to add is Five Guys. I've stuck with the Little Bacon Cheeseburger with mayo and hot sauce (yeah, I'm weird) and tried both regular and Cajun fries (go with the Cajun). Aside from it being so busy and spending an average of 8 minutes in line and 9 minutes waiting for my burger, I've been very happy with Five Guys.",1
"The Matthews Dilworth Coffee often is my \""""office\"""" when I'm running around town looking for a Wireless friendly spot to do freelance work. It's not too crowded, and the staff leaves you alone when you're parking there for a couple of hours...which is all I ask in a coffee shop to earn my love. While I land most often at the Matthews spot, I've also been to the East Blvd. location. Both offer a good selection of coffees and teas.\n\nThey don't have tons of food, but they do have a good enough selection to make a lunch there. I like their Bougie version of the Pimento Cheese sandwich, and their pastries are impressively cream-cheesey.",1
This place sits literally in the doorway of the side entrance of the Mirage casino and is really just your average mediocre burger joint. Ordered some food here when I was drinking across the way at the Rhumbar which allows you to bring food in while you are drinking. The menu is a collection of forgetful selections and drinks and shakes etc. Typical greasy bar food and average burgers. The appetizers include baja tacos and fried dill pickles. Opted to order some of those and it was just okay. Nothing to write home about with steep prices and a place to skip to go 200 feet to the Carnegie Deli down the hall.,0
Slow making subs and service was far from perfect. The bread seemed to sitting out for quite some time so the bread was hard. As well as the music was way too loud I felt like I had to almost shout to be heard to place the order. Even then the order was made incorrectly.  When I kindly approached the guy at the register he seemed to have an attitude.  I am a big fan of Jimmy John's. However this location has a lot to work on in the area of customer service.  It will be awhile before I'm back at this location.,0
"Went here Saturday night, a party of 12, for our work \""""holiday gathering\"""". First time I had ever been, and kind of ashamed to say first time I even noticed this place. Must have driven by  it a couple dozen times, shopping at Traders Joes, and never once noticed it there. \nNeedless to say, I regret not knowing about this place until now. They seemed comfortable handling such a large party, and judging by the party rooms in the back of the restaurant they have plenty of practice! I can't for the life of me remember our servers names (2 gentlemen) but they handled everything great. Each server basically had one side of a very long table. \nGreat explanations and suggestions from the servers. They were extremely knowledgeable about all the food, and promptly answered any questions we had about the menu. Even getting down to details about how the food is prepped and cooked. That I really loved. \nThe apps were great we had the calamari, and crab dip. We ordered 2 of each and they were gone within minutes.\nEveryone seemed to really enjoy their food, out of 12, 1 dish was sent back for being under cooked. I loved my food as did my wife, I had the halibut, which according to our server is one of the most popular on the menu. The halibut was cooked perfectly, served on one of the most delicious crab/potato cakes I have ever had. Wife had the lamb, came cooked perfectly. and was delicious. \nOne drink was forgotten, but was comped at the end.\nOverall, everyone left very happy, all of the staff was great, would love to come back and try it without a huge group!",1
I gave them one more chance and this stay was equally is irritating.  I'm done with them.  It's time to move on to hotels that actually understand what customer service is.,0
"I an a mother of a 2yr old. and i make my daughter learn at an early age that education is IMPORTANT. i use to attend toddler time at the WINDMILL location and they are amazing. i attended library time for my toddler at this location and it was terrible.

"I came here for a friend's birthday last week and experienced the worst service I have ever received. I don't know why, but the waitress avoided our table like the plague. It took forever just to get drinks. We arrived late, after everyone else was done eating, so my friend and I just ordered a quesadilla appetizer to split. We had to ask for plates and silverware... which she forgot and then just gave us some paper cocktail napkins instead. We had also asked for a side of beans to go with the quesadilla. She basically snorted and laughed in our faces and then never brought them out. I understand if perhaps they don't serve beans a la carte (I don't know since we were never offered menus) but there was no explanation given. I have never encountered someone with such a bad attitude at a restaurant before. The other girls said she was like that the whole night. They all left her a bad tip but I think people like that don't understand that's a signal they need to do better next time; instead it just makes the chip on their shoulder get bigger.\n\nI am giving them an extra star since the food was decent and I liked they decor inside. We were out on the patio which was lovely. They had comfy lounge chairs and a fire pit. Its the type of place I would want to hang out and drink Sangria all night. I would definitely return if it weren't for our experience with this waitress. A friend who has been there before said she has had similar issues with another staff member on a separate occasion so its just not worth a return visit.",0
Pathetic. Came to see ice cube at midnight. Still 130 am. Pathetic. Get over yourself C class ice cube... Ice cube has melteddddd... Get over yourself dude,0
"The only reason why I went here was because I had heard rave reviews about the Seafood Fried Rice. \n\nI had the all-you-can-eat sushi special and it was completely sub-par. As far as sushi goes, Ah Sin's sushi is a total sin. The rolls were cold and dry which meant they were likely all pre-made. You can also only order a pre-set number of rolls at one time. Other member of my party had the Seafood Fried Rice which he loved.\n\nIf you have to go here make sure to sit outside on the patio where you'll have a view of the Bellagio fountains which might be the only saving grace of this place.",0
"The food is just \""""eh\"""" here.  We weren't super hungry so we went with the lobster potstickers ($10 for 4), pork sliders ($10 for 3) and the miso glazed sea bass ($34).  It was all just ok.  There wasn't much flavor on the fish.\n\nWe ordered the tiki bowl which consisted of rum, OJ and ice which was ok along with a planters punch and a mai tai (strong!).  The bill came to a little over a $100 but neither of us were very satisfied by the whole meal.  \n\nI prob will never eat here again with so many other options for Asianesque food in Vegas but this would be a great place to hang out and split a scorpion bowl in summer with a group.",0
Absolutely the best hotel in Vegas. ...I've stayed at all top resorts abd and wynn is heads and shoulders above  them all.,1
"Fresh , staff has friendly genuine happiness and the customers are in a great mood ! Much better than the big casino sunday Buffett. It's a sit down and order from menu casual diner. Everyone returns as a friend! If your having a bad day, come  in and relax and get some comfort food with your cell phone turned off! My gym buds pile on the egg whites and fresh oatmeal !!!",1
"I've eaten here twice and try not to go back.  I wish there were more decent dining options on the Square for entertaining out-of-town guests...\n\nAnyway, the first time I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich.  I don't really like grilled cheese and only order them when there are no palatable meat-free options.  It was the usual mess of grease on bread.  The highlight was the shot of harvest soup, but again that was only a shot.  \n\nThe second time we came here was because The Old Fashioned was too busy.  I was fine with that because I'm not a fan of their food, but my friends were visiting and were really excited about the variety of cheese curds.\n\nTo make up for the lack of cheese curds, we ordered the poutine.  Having traveled extensively in Canada, I can say this was a far cry from the original (true, we did get the gravy on the side).  The cheese was lumpy, waxy mess in the middle, and the fries were cold and soggy.  We didn't even finish them, and who doesn't finish their fries?!\n\nI really liked the Venetian Manicotti, though the buckwheat crepe was rather grainy.  That could be the nature of buckwheat, I'm not sure.  I'd definitely order it again, especially if I come here with someone I don't want to talk to.\n\nMy friends all seemed reasonably pleased with their meals, though it was hard to tell because I couldn't hear a word they said.  Between the horrendous acoustics and multiple TVs (with the volume on!), my friends and I quickly learned any attempt at conversation was fruitless.  The whole meal made me feel sad and lonely, because I could see my friends but not talk to them.  It made us eat quickly and run out of there.  One positive note:  I think all the ambient noise mimicked the sounds of my friend's womb.  Her little baby slept through the whole meal.  It was quite nice for us grown-ups.  Too bad we couldn't talk to each other about how lovely it was to have adult conversation.\n\nI don't drink beer, so I ordered a Magner's.  It came in a pint glass, which I'm sure would have been appreciated if I were an alcoholic or like to consume 1500 calories per meal.  I drank less than half of it.  It would be nice to have smaller portions, for those of us who don't like to feel the need purge upon dining.",0
"What the hell happen? I loved this place the first time, now service is slow, the dinning area looked like a school lunchroom mess, and my sandwich almost had some meat on it. What a disappointment in consistency. Not sure I'll be back, but sure glad I got a phone survey on the receipt. Hopefully an a$$ reaming on the review will do some good.",0
"Lets Keep this short and sweet:\nFood = OUTSANDING A+\nCustomer service = B - (at best)\nFacility cleanliness = A from what I could see\nNickel and diming you to death = they are true experts at.\nTo get your plate just the way you want it with all the \""""EXTRAs\"""" plan on spending $12 per plate\nExtras include:\nSalsa on tacos\nCheese\nSour cream\nGuacamole\nChips and salsa are nearly $5 (OUCH) (little baby cups of salsa too btw.)\nThe plate is a good size and the food is good but I left feeling like the opportunist of this business are exploiting their customers on a daily basis.",0
Many of the meats are miss marked. Little bit sorry for those that don't know the cuts.,1
"For some reason, whenever I talk to people about Edinburgh, about the time they spent there when they were kids, they remember Helios Fountain as being a truly magical place. A land full of sparkling beads and shining badges. And cakes that just didn't amount to anything next to the other shiny things. \n\nIt's in the same group as other Grassmarket businesses. It sells quirky things you really don't need. But everything's so shiny and appealing you really do think you need them. I've been warned quite a few times against going there for the sake of my pocket and I normally listen, but I've been in a few times to browse. It's a great place to buy presents when you can't really think of anything to get.",1
"horrible, horrible service!",0
"This used to be one of my go-to lunch spots when I worked from home. The staff was always friendly, they remembered me, the food was good quality at the right price. However, the last few times I've stopped in here, I've left disappointed. My sandwich is often made incorrectly these days. Last time I was in there, it appears there was a new girl learning the register. Another lady, who I assume was the manager, was harshly scolding the girl in front of me for ringing up my order wrong. The cashier was embarrassed, as was I. The whole scene was unnecessary and left me once again feeling disappointed with my experience here.",0
"With the addition of the cronuts and new flavors, I have to rave about the new variety but same old taste. What can I say? Being the duke adds responsibility of ensuring this place gets the credit for best donut shop in Phoenix!\n\nNow, what makes a good donut? It has to be light and fluffy. Not light as in fat free, but light and fluffy, as you take a bite, your teeth sink right through the icing and dough. It leaves a moist chew in your mouth while allowing you to savor the flavor. Rainbow delivers this with every single donut! You got that right, I just dropped some donut knowledge up in here.\n\nI have heard many great things about cronuts. I mean I love croissants, but mixed with a donut? Oh yea, I am feeling the jive now. We tried the glazed and cinnamon. It wasn't light and fluffy, but definitely a soft crunch that packs the same old Rainbow flavor that this location only offers. Does this beat out my maple bar infatuation? Please don't make me choose! However, I will have to be so bold to say that this place keeps getting better. The family is great, the service is top notch, and it makes this Yelper proud to be Duke! Lastly, they mix the cronuts with fresh fruit if you so choose. That is definitely next on my list! Do I even need to say I will see you again Rainbow? Oh yea, probably next Sunday!",1
It's not at this location anymore.  I'm not sure where it is - couldn't find it.,0
"My corporate HQ booked a room for over night business trip. This was bad news from jump. The hotel entrance was behind the building and not well marked. Check in was a disaster. Between the resort fee, security deposit and incidental deposit the room was an additional $165 they wanted to charge to my personal card. I refused to pay for it and started to walk out. They quickly waved all but the resort fee which was billed to the corporate account. I should have kept walking. I was to have a non smoking room with a king size bed. The elevator, hallway and room smelled like an ashtray. I will agree never walk around barefoot in these rooms. The shower tub was straight out of a motel 6. It had a queen size bed that was short sheeted. It didn't have a fitted sheet. The foot of the bed wasn't covered with a sheet so my feet were on the mattress cover. Just nasty. I slept diagonally to keep my feet off the mattress. Next morning I checked out without exploring anything else there. I had our corporate travel planner put this dive on the banned list and would suggest that everyone else do the same.",0
Totally not worth your money.  The food was bland.  I know what good Ethiopian food is and this place does not serve it.,0
"The food is OK, nothing really exciting.  We had the beef ribs, pork ribs, rice & beans, and mac & cheese.  The beef ribs were uber tough and dry.  I was extremely disappointment.  The pork ribs were better - kinda good.  I didn't taste the rice & beans as I'm not a fan but the mac & cheese was pretty mediocre, just like any other mac & cheese.\n\nThe place is super small and didn't really seem that clean.  All the furniture was mix-matched.  A true whole in the wall  but the staff was nice.",0
"Worst place i've eaten in a long time. The waitress was very indifferent to how our food was,wheather we were happy with it or not. Way over priced. Much more experience than most mexican restaurants. Whoever called this tex mex has never had real tex mex. Don't even know where it came by the the name. Give this place a pass. There are way too many restaurants in the area to go to this one. All Mexican restaurants give free chips,this one charges. You even have to request hot sauce. I wrote a complaint via the internet to Cactus Jack and they didn't even bother to respond. I hope this place goes under quickly and allows a decent restaurant to take its place.",0
"Its actually a Salvadorean restaurant and not Mexican food. Its family owned and it offers a no frills dining experience. However the service is fast and friendly. In and out quick dining. Everything is prepared by a mom and her daughters in the kitchen and it has the feeling of a restaurant in a small Salvadorean town. Their Pupusas are the best in the city hands down. I constantly order them to go when ever I am in the area and their Tamarindo drink is made fresh everyday.  The pricing is fantastic: easily feed four people for about $20. If nothing else the pricing, Pupusas, tamarind and speed of service makes me a fan.",1
"Great drinks, and cigar selection.\n\nI went with an old bartender, and he had us try everything on the menu. If you like mixed drinks this is the place for you. They have a very wide selection of alcohol, so I'm sure you'll be able to get the drink made just the way you like it. *****",1
"I ADORE Ross J's. I use to work in the same parking lot and would often forget my lunch on purpose so I could walk and buy my lunch here. I wish I lived/ worked near by but then again I would eat here everyday if I did. \n\nThe prices are very affordable and the owner and his daughter are just lovely. I always get great service here, never any issues. \n\nI usually order the spicy chicken or the chicken teriyaki add broccoli. The portions are huge, I can't really finish a whole plate on my own. The chicken is cooked perfectly not over done, still moist and juicy. OH and I love the fact they have koolaid.\n\nSeriously if you are ever in the area check them out, they are amazing!!",1
"Three words:  Dreary.  Bleak.  Pretentious.\n\nI really don't understand what the hype is about.  I felt like I was sitting inside a warehouse, the atmosphere is austere and unwelcoming...and it didn't help that the complimentary popcorn was burned. I couldn't get out of there fast enough.",0
Of course for this place you know you're going to get big portions.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable and after we were seated she started firing information at us but she was going so fast that I missed most of it.  The dining room was really nice but it is what you would expect out of a high end steakhouse. We ordered a soup and a salad to share.  Both weren't really worth the $10 each.  We had the porter house steak which was cooked perfectly and not disappointing at all.  The highlight was the side dish though.  The potatoes were excellent.  So cheesy and creamy and fantastic.  Needless to say we didn't take any of those home with us!  This was a good meal and the service was great.  I would return.,1
"The waitress we had here was horrible.  The bus boy gave us more attention than she did.  I say give him her job!  The food was OK nothing spectacular, a little over priced, but you are paying for the ambiance I guess.",0
The staff has been pretty good here for the most part but the seating area is awful and gotten worse.   Recently went there to relax before an appointment.  It was cold outside but I didn't expect it to be cold inside.  I wore my coat the whole time as it was quite chilly and they took out the nice upholstered chairs and put in stools and wooden chairs.   Up front there are just tall barstools.  Not a comfortable coffee shop.   Also the coffee is hit and miss for flavor.   it wouldn't take much for a new coffee shop to move in and take away the business from them.   Any takers?  Please say yes.,0
"Holy schlamoly! This place CHANGED. The first time I came here back in 2004 it was a BREWERY. It was cool, it was fun, it was affordable. The beer was good and made there...\n\nFast forward to my last visit in 2010. It's a lot more...douchy. I'm not sure what made them make such a drastic change. The place used to smell of hops and malt (which smells like burnt wet oatmeal if you haven't had the pleasure). Now, it's just like any sports bar on the strip. Gone are the tanks, the smell of brewing beer, and that brewpub feel.\n\nAnd it is freaking expensive. Unless you make it for Happy Hour - which unfortunately we were too early for. I talked this place up and was sorely disappointed by the changes. I really had no reason to come to the Monte Carlo other than this spot. We had to walk through that hotel/casino that smelled like old lady perfume. I had such a headache after that adventure.\n\nMy advice - avoid this spot if you are looking for a unique place to have a pint. Or, if you have to go, go during happy hour.",0
The Pharmacy is HORRIBLE. They have become slow as molasses over the years. I just had dental surgery and dropped off 2 prescriptions with a mouth packed full of gauze and was told it would take 1 1/2 hours. I asked if it could be ready any sooner and was told they'd do an emergency fill within 20 min. 1 hour later and I'm still sitting in my car waiting for the damn prescriptions as I change my gauze every 15 min in the car. I am done with Walgreens for good,0
"I received a gift card, and I read some bad reviews on here, so I was a little nervous when I dropped in today. The girl at the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful.  I lucked out because it wasn't busy, so I got seated right away for my pedicure. The girl that did my mani/pedi was nice and she did a good job...no complaints. It's cool that they do little beauty parties & I will keep that in mind for the future.",1
"Ever taken a flight on a crusty dog turd? Neither have I, but I imagine it's not much unlike flying US Airways--the all time worst airline in every conceivable way.\n\nHow does an airline (that is already at the bottom of the barrel) get away with cutting back so ridiculously far on service while simultaneously  jacking up prices so ridiculously high on everything from water to luggage to aisle seats?!\n\nWow, great business plan, douchebags--take something that already sucks, make it worse and charge people more for it!  \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the greedy crack smokers that run this airline started charging for toilet paper. By the square.",0
"My wife our friend Kathy R. and myself stopped here for lunch. As soon as we stepped in, we were greeted by Lacey who was extremely friendly.  Lacey gave us ample time to Perouse  the menu until we all deicide what we wanted. \n\nFor starters I ordered the Calamari for my wife & I . It was alright, thinly coated but not really fired the way I normally like. It was decent but not special. I've had way better here in Arizona..\n\nOur waitress brought us the beverages we ordered then took our meal order. Dinner gets off to a good start here with a nice basket of garlic bread sticks,Our entrees came shortly thereafter. Our friend started with the soup which she said was absolutely delicious.  For her entr\u00e9e Kathy got the Ziti with a side salad. She raved about the garlic dressing. And kept going on and on about it until her meal came. She thought the Ziti was outstanding.  For dessert Kathy got the home made Tiramisu. It was soaked in brandy and espresso, layered with sweetened marscapone cheese and kahlua.  Topped off with cocoa powder. She thought it was outstanding.\n\nMy wife Carol decided on the  Sausage, peppers & onions (Mild Italian Sausage slow baked with sweet peppers, onions, marinara sauce and spices with side of pasta). Carol thought the dish was superb. For dessert Carol got the Lemoncello Marscapone Cake. Carol loves lemon and said it was A delightful and light lemon flavored cake. It was and rich and loaded with delicious Lemon flavor.\n\nI got the Veal Parmesan it came with a small dinner salad and pasta w/ marinara sauce. The pasta is extremely high quality-- perfectly cooked. The veal parmesan was tender and prepared nicely. I always judge an Italian restaurant on the Veal Parmesan if they have it or the eggplant parmesan. In this case it was the veal. The dish was classic  Italian fare, nothing really different than what you find on every menu Italian Restaurant in Arizona.  But it was pretty tasty. For dessert I ordered the cheese cake. It was creamy and rich but nothing special.\n\nFOOD: Food was very good. Kathy R. and my wife was impressed with the quality of their dish. As for me I thought the food was good but didn't knock my socks off like I was expecting. While everything tasted fine, I did not taste any heart or soul in the dishes and Italian food normally has a lot of TLC along with heart and soul put into their dishes. SERVICE:Lacey provided us with Tremendous service. PRICE: The prices on the lunch menu wasn't terrible. CONCLUSION: Nice atmosphere.  Relaxed, unpretentious, and comfortable in a way that makes you want to spend time just chatting with friends. The portions were just right for lunch not to big that you left stuffed but not  small where you left hungry. You cannot go home hungry from here.  RETURN FACTOR 100%. \n  \n    ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************\n5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! \n4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. \n3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. \n2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. \n1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH \n\nThe portions were huge, the prices were very reasonable and the food was fantastic!  I would definitely recommend Little Bite of Italy and I'll certainly go back again",1
Food so good I'd lick the plate. Service makes you feel like your in a four star restaurant. T,1
"Uneven - at best\n\nVisited for Restaurant Week on 5/18.  Had high expectations as the restaurant had been mentioned by AZ Central restaurant critic as a place to try.  One of us ordered the salad and one the canadian bacon.  The salad was OK, just lettuce but the dressing was tasty.  We notice other diners having the same salad had additional ingredients like tomato and onion.  I think of canadian bacon as very lean, the bacon served was not.  Didn't really care for it that much.  For dinner, one of us had the sirloin and the other the filet medallions.  Again, not what I would consider high quality beef and the sauce on the medallions was extremely salty.  The mash and broccoli served with it were uninspired and pretty much unseasoned.  The carrot cake for desert was flavorless.  Our server was just OK, and we didn't appreciate having to overhear the servers vying for tables.\n\nSounds like it's the luck of the night whether or not a dining experience here will be good or not so good.  We're frequent diners and it's unlikely we'll be back.",0
Love all the delicious goodies!! And they have gluten free cakes that are delicious! Love the service. The owner Bre is so sweet.,1
"So tonight, I rolled up to the hostess, and said \""""worlds smallest birthday party for one please\"""". \nI was given birthday wishes by every member of the staff, including the head chef of all of katsuya who came to my table and called me by my name because he remembered me from the last time I was there.\nThe SLS Hotel gives you a $30 dining credit for your birthday, which is also nice, so I loaded up on wagyu beef. So melt in your mouth delicious. I had red snapper sushi with yuzu/pepper , wagyu sashimi, wagyu sushi, creamy spicy rock shrimp tempura on a spicy tuna roll and the Fairbanks roll.  I was sooooo full, but thank god for my separate desert stomach, because my strawberry birthday mochi was the best I ever had. I'm not a fan of it normally,, but now I will always order it from here.\nThanks for my genuine birthday love, amazing food and great service, Katsuya!",1
"ok, I have changed my insurance carrier about a 6 months ago and I thought, well what's the big deal, they're all the same, wrong, unfortunately I was involved in 2 incidents since I got the new policy, not my fault but I must say I was impressed with the way it was handled, from the customer service to the appointment to drop off and pick up the car after it was repaired, painless, I didn't have too many providers before but for me at this point I don't know what would make me change to another insurance company. I only have good words to say about the people that handled my claim.",1
"The food is great! Only giving 2 stars because service has gotten worse each time we started eating here. If you don't mind being asked for your order multiple times, this place is it! But the food is really good though.",0
"Last week I went in at around 8:00am and bought a Breakfast Roll which has elements of breakfast in it ... ham, egg, cheese, but bakedn in a whole wheat roll. It was stale and hard and ... although I tried ... ultimatedly inedible. I was very sad. I like the \""""idea\"""" of Great Harvest Bread company but in actual life it's stale ... i had a deja vu of why I hadn't been back in over a year ... I had bought a morning muffin or breakfast roll a year ago .. it was stale.  And didn't go back until time passed and I forgot about the bad experience. Now I have 2 things to remind me not to go back in the future. I emailed the company and told of the staleness and ... no reply. So that's why I'm writing this review.\n\nUpdate: I received this reply from the owner a week later ... so I will up my rating to 3 stars ...\n\nGood Afternoon, \n \nThank you for taking the time to send us an e-mail about a less than satisfactory product you purchased in our bakery last Thursday.  First I have to appolgize for taking so long to get back to you.  As you may know this little shop is owned by our family, and with that we are always busy doing many things.  From Farmer's Markets on both Thursdays and Saturdays,  to baking 125 loaves of bread Saturday with a Church Youth Group for their moms on Sunday, visiting with folks at a local retirement home yesterday and a seminar I had commited to today.  Wow,  it's been a busy week, and that only covers the past 5 days.  I finally had a chance to check my e-mails.  The business e-mails go to my husband and he forwarded yours onto my personal e-mail so that I may answer you.  \n \nAnyways,  I appreciate your patience.  We do bake all of our breakfast rolls every morning.  The one that you purchased wouldn't have been old, but it would have had to have been overbaked to be inedible.  I really sincerely apologize for that.  We do make everything here in the bakery from scratch and with that sometimes leaves room for human error.  \n \nSo to thank you for taking the time to send us an e-mail, I would like to make things right and offer you - your choice a sandwich or any loaf of bread. \n\nMy compliments of course.  I am typically here in the bakery Mon-Wed all day.  Thursday only 'til 1:00 - then off to a Farmers Market.  All day Friday. and another Farmers Market on Saturday.  We are closed on Sundays for family time.  I will be putting your name on our message board with instructions for a Free Sammie or Loaf of Bread.  \n \nWarmly, \nLeslie Walston,  Owner\nGreat Harvest Bread Co. 1730\n___________________________________________________\n\n[update 5/30/10]: I did go back and unfortunately ordered a savannah bar and iced coffee. The savannah bar was okay but small. The iced coffee I had a sinking feeling as I saw the person pull dig the cut in a bucket of ice and proceed to pour hot coffee over it. This is going to water down by 50% an already weak coffee. I asked if she could give me a little less ice, she obliged but that just resulted in a dishwater, luke-warm watery coffee that was undrinkable. So I was foiled again. I sent an email to the owner again suggesting they serve full strenght coffee that's been kept in a refrigerator then poured over ice ... no reply back.\n\nSo I'm sorry to say I've downgraded my rating to 2 starts ** . And I'm sorry to say I will likley not go back. Too disappointing even though I want it to be better.",0
"From our entire family to your team - we want to say a heartfelt thank you for the kindness, hospitality, and generosity you showed us in our time of need. \n\nAfter my mothers passing, we chose Va Bene for a memorial dinner, and you handled it professionally, respectably, and delicately for us during a very emotional time. \n\nThe food was unbelievable, the choice of wine (which we left up to you) was perfect, and the atmosphere was both warm and comforting. Thank you again for everything.",1
"Too bad can't indicate zero. Used a Groupon. Food was poor, service indifferent.  Decor takes you back to the 80s but not in a good way (like a banquet hall of a Holiday Inn in Muncie Indiana).  Had fun surprise of additional charges on my credit card which I had to dispute.  \n\nIf you want good tapas / Spanish food, go to Tapas Papas Fritas.",0
"My wife and I tried out Verde during its soft opening after eagerly following the progress for months. We were not disappointed. We each tried a salad (verde and Caesar) and an entree (carne asada and pescado veracruz). We also ordered a flight of tequila, which came with a delicious sangrita palate cleanser. \n\nPROS: \n- Fantastic and well-priced selections from the bar. As a bar, Verde is incredible and is well-worth a visit.\n- Nice, modern decor and layout. Plenty of room for each table. \n- Overall, with some reservations, the flavors of the food are bold and well-balanced. \n- Service was attentive and timing was great. We didn't wait too long for any of our courses, but also didn't feel rushed. They seemed very eager to discuss any questions, particularly relating to tequila. \n- Portion sizes were good. The salads were quite sizable, and the entrees were appropriate.\n\nCONS:\n- Some small execution issues: my wife's fish was slightly overcooked (and thus dry) and some of our tortilla chips were chewy (although most were wonderfully crisp)\n- There wasn't much spicy heat to any of our dishes. While everything was well-seasoned, I was hoping for some more zing.\n\nOverall, I wish I could give 4.5 stars, since I hate docking a whole one, but it's not quite to the 5 star level just yet. However, Verde is still so young, I can see the seed of a really great restaurant, and it's seems like it will only get better. Pittsburgh is sorely lacking in this style of food, so it's a welcome addition to the local scene. We'll be going back, for sure.",1
"Overall was not impressed by the food or service.  There was one waitress working while another three were sitting at the bar when I came in, I sat and gave my drink order then had to change it since they only do Pepsi products.  The whole time I was in there I think I saw one of the other workers get up once to do something then sit right back down even when a couple more groups came in.  \n\nI ordered the original special with fries, the food came out pretty fast and you can tell right off the bat it's the same kind of fries you'll get from Harris Teeter next door.  The burger was what I went in for and it was decent but nothing to make me want to go back.  It was pretty much the same burger you would get at Cookout and a little better than Hardees.  \n\nFor $10 including tip I want something a little better than this, I'll probably be sticking to other places for a burger and Davinci's for lunch/dinner in that strip.",0
I have lived in the area for 7 years and the service is the same. Short of not opening the doors. Rude and unprofessional staff. Customer service training for management staff is required.,0
Everyone friendly. Nice atmosphere. Service was excellent. Food was delicious (loved the pork tacos).  Wonderful new neighborhood restaurant!,1

"Ok spicy actually really means spicy here! For those who are looking for the mecca  Pakistanese and Indian of take-out restaurants in Montreal, look no further. Open 7 days a week until 11:00pm every day, you can find an elaborate variety of 17 types of curries, 7 different types of balti, 10 types of biryani, 14 assorted vegetarian dishes, 10 Pakistani naans and the list goes on. Personal favorites are the lamb vindaloo, chicken bhuna, shrimp jalfrazi, bhindi and dal channa. Ask for different levels of spice to get a feel for the difference - you won;t regret it!",1

"This is my favorite coffee shop. I go here EVERY Wednesday after stopping at the Town & Country farmer's market, and lately I've been convincing the parents to join me for brunch after church on Sundays. Guess you could say I'm a regular.\n\nI always order the same drink because it's just so good - iced almond milk mocha. Sometimes I'll get a little crazy and add some caramel. Watch out. \n\nEverything I've eaten there has been fantastic (and I've eaten a lot). If you've been to Paris and you are aching for a croissant, but those huge undercooked limp things in the Starbucks refrigerator case just aren't doing it for you - you have to have one at Carmel's. Perfection.\n\nMake sure to go out back and enjoy your latte or crepes. They made the best out of that little area. \n\nPat, the owner, is awesome. I love chatting with him about old music. One day I came in and he was snacking on a fresh orange behind the counter - he randomly just stuck out the plate to me. I remember that just putting a huge smile on my face.\n\nLittle things go a long way....and Carmel's is full of them.",1
"The rooms are nice, bed is comfy, tub is huge, 2 bathrooms one with a double sink, stylish. The room is really noisy. We had a corner room with a nice view but we can hear music bumping on the 20th floor, probably coming through the vents. There's some weird rattling noise and some other noise (maybe the elevators?) going on all the time, REALLY annoying. The housekeeping has been pretty rediculous, 1 day out of 4 they came to clean the room without me asking 5 times. Overall I'd stay somewhere else.",0
"I am a frequent customer at Tropical  Smoothie not only for their amazing smoothies but because they support Camp Sunshine in Maine where I have been many times when my child was battling cancer. However, this Sunday I was so disappointed in the three flat bread sandwiches I received. I ordered 2 steak tzaziki flat breads and one chicken chipolte flat bread. Unfortunately, the steak flat breads where loaded with purple onions.  Overwhelmingly loaded!! The steak was chewy and at times I could not manage to swallow the steak due to it's texture. My boyfriend had the same complaints with his steak  tzaziki flat bread. The chicken flat bread was absent the chicken!!  \n\nWe took our order home so we didn't have the luxury of resolving this issue immediately. However, I did call and spoke to a young lady (Bianca) who was very pleasant and insisted that only one tablespoon of onions is used in each flat bread and I insisted that there was definitely more than one tablespoon. She than proceeded to tell me that next time I should order it without onions... Really???? I enjoy steak with onions but not onions with steak! \n\nMy smoothies were on point... As usual. However, the flat breads were beyond edible. I thinkTropical Smoothie should stick with what they know &/ provide better training in sandwich making and customer complaints.",0
"First of all don't buy more than one yelp coupon at a time cause you can only use one at a time and they stated that they prefer to give one ticket per table. Now I'm stuck with 2 more coupons that I probably won't use. The salsa was a little hot for me but the chips were fresh and delicious. We got the cheddar quest and it was delicious as well. I was very exited for the creamed corn side dish and it was a little hot for me but was delicious and I ate it even though my nose was running from it. I ordered the quesadilla and it was just basically plain chicken and cheese. Finally something not burning my mouth. My dinner guests had the Barbacoa burrito, which was huge, and the tilapia Cesar salad which looked good. Everyone ate all of their food! The service is where this place goes down hill. Had to wave her down for everything and wasn't overly friendly. If your going for the food it's pretty good just don't go there looking for the best service.",0
"For the price I paid for my sushi, I would at least expect it to be edible. My scallop roll was so tart, the sauce overpowering and the scallop meat warm that I ate two to be polite and left the rest to be thrown away- which I hate to do. My friends seemed to enjoy their dishes though, but coming from San Francisco I think it's wrong to make people pay $25 for Chinese food.\n\nRedeeming qualities... um... umm... it was fun saying Shibuya Shibuya Shibuya throughout dinner.",0
"Went in and tried the pork rib and fatty brisket and it was pretty good. I generally don't care for pork ribs but it literally fell off the bone and was very moist and juicy. The brisket has just enough fat and was very flavorful. \n\nThey had 3 different kinds of bbq sauces sweet, smokey and a white thunder. The sweet is a typical bbq sauce, smokey was my favorite and white thunder was pretty much just heat. \n\nPrices are pretty much standard to other bbq places starting around $8. Since this is closer to my job I'd definitely go back.",1
"Like most casino clubs, walk around looking good and someone will come up to you and ask you to fill their establishments.  We got suckered into this place after watching Criss Angel, see my Yelp! review on that.  A nice gentleman in a black suit approached us and asked if we'd check out the club.  He skipped us past the lines and velvet ropes, no clue if there was an entrance fee, and just moseyed on up the spiral staircase (take the elevator to the second floor, if you're lazy).\n\nOnce atop, you are greeted by what I call a Cleopatra-esque chase.  It's got a spotlight on it and just screams \""""Come!  Take a cheesey Vegas club picture on me.\""""  Afterwhich, there are two rooms with a long bar in each.  You have to go through the first room to enter the second.  The earlier of which is slightly more subdue and... well, empty.  The second room holds the louder crowd with it's stages for bolder females to dance on and blaring Top 40 pop remixes and \""""oldie-but-goodie\"""" club mixes, which if you stay long enough, you'd hear several songs repeated.\n\nWe found, what we thought was a little gem to this place.  There was a photobooth in an almost hidden niche. .. but, seriously, $10?!  One of my companions  just pulled out their camera and started shooting, did some photo editing when we got home, and wa-lah! our own version (in the same booth, I might add... LOL!)\n\nAnyhow, the fact that we didn't pay for anything (to queue or entrance) was somewhat redeeming.  Otherwise, I'd say that I'd go elsewhere for the true Vegas club life experience.\n\nAttire: Semi-Casual",0
"Friday night date night.\nFish fry.\nDrinks.\nGreat ambiance and Bartender.\n\nThis is my second time here; we were in the mood for fish and decided to check out reviews and decided on B&H.  Once we entered, there was a bit of a wait (Friday night, no surprise there.)  The lady in front of us was all exasperated because her party had a 20 minute wait.  After she huffed off I greeted the hostess with a smile and said, \""""There'll be just two (2) of us, we don't mind the wait and we'll be at the bar until you're ready for us.  The name is China, like the country.\""""  In which she smiled and replied, \""""I love you.\""""  *chuckling*\n\nI said \""""hey, fellow service industry workers have to stick together; on and off the clock.\""""\n\nHe saved me a seat at the bar and our Bartender's name was Kevin; my beau ordered the New Belgium Snapshot beer. I asked Kevin if he had any mint, he said not quite yet; next month for sure.  So I ordered a Hendrick's gin cocktail with muddled lemon and lime on the rocks topped with 7-Up.  He said, \""""a woman who knows what she wants. Perfect.\""""  \n\nMy beau ordered the Perch and I had the deep fried cod with the asparagus.  Awesome...\n\nI will be back; hopefully it won't take another two (2) years.\n\nYou should go here.  Soon!",1
"I love this place. I have a family of 6. My children and husband love the pizza here. We usually get a giant, and it feeds everyone + gives us enough for leftovers for lunch the next day. I usually get their traditional Gyro for myself, which is great.  \n\nThe service is wonderful and they always take care of us. They mixed up our order once, but were great about quickly fixing it for us. They even insisted we keep the stuff we didn't order, at no cost to us.",1
"A clean,well - lit place pho you to enjoy something tasty.  \n\nEven though Kung Fu Chef is predominantly a Chinese restaurant, they also serve pho, and do they ever!  \n\nThe Pho Tai (med-rare thin sliced beef) was maybe the best Pho I've had in the valley.  This bowl of fabulous pho was fragrant, flavorful, and fulfilling.  The Vermicelli had just the right texture and the symphony of \""""wow that's good,\"""" flavors had me excited about my next bite.  The cilantro and onion were what stood out most in the soup, and since I love both of those things, I was very satisfied. \n\nThe servers were very friendly and happy to answer all of my American questions, usually beginning with \""""what's this?\"""" \n\nKung Fu Chef is all about good tasting Pho, a diverse selection of Chinese cuisine, great value, and a warm and inviting atmosphere.",1
"What a gem this place is! I wish there was a location in the southwest side of town, because I would go there everyday. I like to compare this place to In-N-out..... not that it is the same type of food, but it is similar in simplicity! They only have a few items on their menu (like in-n-out). It's just genius. I hate going to places that have a billion items on their menu and it takes me forever to look over everything and then the food is blah. This chicken strip place is awesome! \n\nGet your chicken strips either Baked, Fried, or Grilled! Simple as that! \nAnd the fried strips are coated in panko crumbs, which makes it taste better then regular battered fried chicken. \n\nTheir frys are as expected.....BUT the baked Mac-N-Cheese is what makes it.\nIt comes in a round tin container, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it is plenty. It has this layer of cheese on top that is slightly burnt, not the gross burnt, but that slight cheese burnt. If you are a cheese lover, there is no denying this place's Mac-N-Cheese! \n\nIt is also family owned which I love to support in this town! \n\nLastly, their prices are reasonable, on the cheaper side. Its great that this place is in business. I hope they do well and open up more locations!",1
"wanted some good snacks went to beso for the appetizers and it was horrible. the strip steak taco were cold, the beans were cold,  we order the paella which looked like jalapeno popper the outside was warm but the center was cold. the octopus was marinated nicely, the server  hardly asked us if we were enjoying are meal spent most of his time hitting on the two ladies next to us. . .  i expected better for a place on the strip.",0
"I love going to casinos and enjoying myself... except this one... which simply wants to make me leave and save up for a Las Vegas vacation. Some of the worst slot machines, ever. Some of them are just so old that they date from the date that the casino was opened. The newer ones don't seem to include very many popular machines (which makes me think that someone is buying machines based on price... or based on kickback.) The few popular machines, like Monopoly have people crowding around waiting for people to leave. High limits on tables, if you can find one or a space at one. Minimum $25 at the card tables, $10/$15 on craps. Casino employees are government employees and yet now they have signs and expect tips. Still low on customer service.\n\nFrankly, it's time to shut this down and hire a for-profit company to do this right. Beautiful building... lousy casino.",0
"i like this location - whenever i'm in the neighborhood i try to stop by. i like that it is in an older complex. i feel good about buying fresh, healthy stuffs for me, my husband and our dogs here. i like the prices a lot. i like that the people are nice and their eggs are the best tasting in all the land. i don't like that pomegranate seeds are hard to come by. i get sad when they're out of cheese curds. and i get frustrated when it is super busy. but otherwise, i really like this trader joe's.",1
"I have never had a bad steak from here, and my son loves that he can throw his peanut shells on the floor and I won't get onto him about cleaning it up LOL.. Prices are moderate but the food is great.",1
"Whoot, this place has some very interesting flavors, such as White Chocolate. I really wanted to try that one, but they were all out :( so I ended up with the cool looking Marble cupcake. The cake was super moist and light- a mix of chocolate and vanilla, and the frosting was piled high and thick! But not overly sweet at all- which was very surprising since most places have extremely sugary frosting. Not this one! I really enjoyed my cupcake- but my friend didn't like hers. It was dry and far too much peanut butter had been put into (she got the Reeses cupcake) that she felt like all she was eating was a spoon of PB. \n\nThe only issue I have here is that at noon, which is the time we got there, they had dry cupcakes and not very many at all. This leads me to wonder if they get a lot of people in the minute they open who take all the cupcakes, or they just don't keep a good stock. Either way I  really did like the Marble cupcake (SO GOOD) and want to come back to try, hopefully, the White Chocolate one!",1
"Went for lunch today... 110 degrees outside.... so decided to sit in the conservatory instead of directly on the patio. Still a fabulous view and a few degrees cooler.\nLunch was great!\nEscargot was very nice, and the baguette bread dipped in the pesto garlic butter sauce....YUMMY!!!\nLobster Roll and House Special Chicken Sandwich were delicious.\nReally like this place... nice food, nice ambiance, good service, I recommend giving it a try.",1
"**Summary**\n       - Tempura batter - I could hardly find my shrimp in my tempura\n       - Rice - Their portions of rice are insane. The fish are sliced so thin that a couple were literally see through. They even had rice in their dynamite. Who does that?\n       - Freshness - Average.\n       - Portions - The slivers of fish that were given on both rolls and nigiri made me question if they  believed fish had gone extinct. I was able to see the rice beneath the half sliver of Uni I got.\n       - Advertised - They did not have hamachi kama as promised and did not honor their half roll policy.\n       - Decor - I must give it to them however, the ambiance inside gave a very modern and hip feel.\n**Price**\n       - $23.95 for dinner(3pm-11pm) AYCE Sushi\n**Ordered**\n       - Uni (Sea Urchin) - Mediocre quality UNI on an over filling bed of rice.\n       - Saba (Mackerel) - Good quality piece. It tried it's best to cover the rice beneath it.\n       - Popcorn Lobster Roll - A very good roll. I've never seen another place offer this. One of the only things I enjoyed here.\n       - Red & Red Roll - Tuna one spicy tuna. The ponzu sauce was good.\n       - Aged Tofu - Tasteless\n       - Screaming Orgasm - I believe that the seared ahi tuna slices were indeed anorexic and malnourished.\n       - Oysters - Not bad. Partially frozen in the middle though.\n       - Chicken Wing (garlic) - Dryest and worst chicken wing I've ever had.\n       - Shrimp Tempura - 4-1 tempura batter to shrimp ratio.\n       - Croquette - Ordinary but not bad.\n       - Tempura Ice Cream & Green Tea Mochi - Out of a box generic taste.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you have a passion for rice and disliked thick pieces of fish.",0
"Wow sure wish me and my GF read all these reviews before we sat down in this Tourists Trap of a place.. We live in OC and go to Garden Grove for great Korean BBQ, this place is Far Far anything that we are accustom too... The service sucked, the food sucked, the bathroom looked like it hasn't been cleaned properly in many years.. In their display case they show old frozen food that is dated over a month old...

"Awesome experience here. Chocolate chip pancakes were great, homemade muffin fantastic and amazing service. Waitress offered to grab us to-go drinks and food was out within 10 minutes of ordering (even with the restaurant full). Great dinner feel and exceptional service. Highly recommend.",1
"Absolutely tasty!  TONS of vegetarian options, including specials, the bahn mi is SO tasty, but so is the stir fry and the pho!  The vegan fish sauce it awesome, I always ask for a little cup to dip my sandwich in.  The puddings (only $1) are a tasty little treat to end the meal.  All around great place to get a bite!",1

"I was surprised at how small the menu was and without many choices I ordered the BBQ burger, my girlfriend didn't order anything because the limited choices weren't appealing to her, and her son got the kids hot dog. My burger came out pretty quick but just the burger no hot dog. I thought it was probably on the way but after quite some time we realized they forgot it. The bartender noticed there was no other food on the table and asked if we were ok. We told him no and he told a lady that we never got the hotdog and not believing us even though the table only had one plate on it she asked to see our receipt kind of rudely like we were lying. Shortly after the hot dog came out and she said sorry but didn't seem sincere or like she wanted to help make up for the problem. Then I felt that the small burger that doesn't come with fries wasn't going to be enough so I went to order fries and then get 2 drinks at the bar. When I got back to the table the fries were there but the girl who asked to see the receipt tried to make it seem like they were giving us an order of fries to make up for the situation to my girlfriend when the reality is I paid for them.\n\nThis was my first and only time going here. The customer service was terrible and the burger was mediocre and small. I was expecting more flavor. The only positive was the bartender as he was the only one that tried to help when he noticed that my girl's son didn't have food in front of him and was helpful on suggesting a white IPA beer to me that was delicious.",0
Currently staying here now I'm west wing out room has small hole in ceiling maybe from a leak not sure but for expensive room per night I wouldn't expect that.

Sat at $1 wheel of fortune playing for hours and cocktail waitress only came once spent $209 purchasing drinks could've been gambling with that. Not the best.,0
"Incompetent!!! Spent an inordinate amount of time getting an appointment set up and Kristen did not get it right! Sent me to a site where they don't do the study that I needed. She got on the phone multiple times to \""""call the site\"""" to \""""verify\"""". Never emailed me the instructions as she said she would. Got there 30 mins prior to my appointment having been NPO \nfor 2 hrs. No deodorant. No lotion. Total if an hour driving time. Naturally I am peeves because on a day that I shuffled my schedule and I'm crunched for time, I waited 45mins and had i not asked an approx time that they could get me in I would not have been informed of this goof up. Naturally they've already taken my very hefty payment. Trish at the 19th ave site was amazing in helping to rectify the problem. On my way to the other site that Kristen was able to schedule i get a call from her that she would like to schedule something different since she double booked me and want to be mindful of my time. Additionally it is to be noted that the 19th Ave site is not pleasant. Smells. All sites should strive for the Mountain View standard.",0
"HOURS: \n   T-F: 9-5\n   S-Su: 10-4\n\nThought it'd be smartest to first post the hours because they are a bit unconventional. They've eluded me a few times when I first heard about the place, somehow always at the times when I was most craving their crepes!!",1
This place was the worse buffet yet. A hard stiff fish that was diagusting. The ribs were so dry. The pasta was flavorless.  The turkey was drier than ever.  It was just really gross food.,0

"Aiello's is awesome and is a great date restaurant.\n\nVery low key, relaxing environment with really good Italian food.\n\nI've been to Aiello's a hand full of times and would say that my favorite menu items are the lasagna, chicken parm, and the spaghetti with meatballs. Aiello's has the best meatballs I've ever had. \n\nAlso, Joe the owner is very friendly and really makes you feel at home.\n\nAiello's has a decent wine list and has very reasonable prices.\n\nAwesome food, very friendly service, and reasonable prices, gives Aiello's five stars.",1
I had an aweful experience with this location while trying to order for 48 teachers for our school teacher appreciation.  It took me three phone calls to different managers to get an answer on the order to begin(I should have gone to a different restaurant then)after finally getting a response I ordered 48 burritos via a manager.  When my other PTA board member went to pay he confirmed that we had 5 burritos ordered.  Those were the 5 special ones and not the other 43.  They didn't know about a discount they had given us and the tax exempt.  She was told to bring it when I picked up and they would credit her card.  Well I was worried about my order so I showed up 15 minutes early the manager let me know I was early.  I informed her that I knew that.  I also was right in knowing they had my order wrong.  The manager from the night prior never passed my order to them so it was all wrong.  I waited and as I had 48 teachers waiting for dinner they finished late.  I asked if I could speak to a manager and no one would come speak to me.  They denied ever saying we could use our tax exempt form and would not credit us saying that no one ever told us that and told me they were sorry I felt the way I did.  Never and apology never is there anyway I can help NOTHING.  i totally understand human error but they treated me like dirt.  I would never recommend using them for any large party.  I had multiple burritos marked veggie and chicken and scratched out as teachers waited for their food during conferences.  Also when I asked for the area managers card they said they did not have his information!!!!,0
I doubt that I'm cool enough to be a regular but that doesn't stop me from frequenting the place so that I can enjoy their date/bacon appetizer.  Good bless happy hour specials.,1
"Panera has the best coffee ever. Hazelnut coffee, that is. For that, I have to give them credit. \n\nFor the way their restaurant handled the homeless guy the day I was there, I have to say... stay away from this place. I sit down at an extremely dirty table. It was the only option I had since I was limited to the plug on the wall. A guy at the table next to me even offered me a napkin so I didn't have to put my laptop on the gross table.\n\nAcross from me sat a man, asleep, hand in a bag of chips that weren't from Panera, and water bottle full of who knows what on his table. He would occasionally wake up, disturb the people all around him by yelling gibberish, eat a chip and fall asleep while chewing. He even got up, filled his water bottle with a fountain drink, shook it up and yelled \""""pop\"""" across the restaurant as the top of his water bottle goes flying and pop comes spewing out. \n\nWhat gets me is... the employee working came over and had a conversation with him. Never once asked him to leave or anything. Just a BS conversation.\n\nPanera! Raise your standards! Your customers were annoyed by this dude and the fountain drink machine is... eww. If you want to be a little higher in price and come off as a classier place, you need to be classier and take care of situations like this. Panera on Shadyside... no thanks!",0
"The overall experience was great but I did leave my watch there and the manager Jamila or however it is spelled refused to send me my watch back free of charge and even asked me \""""now why would we do that\"""" and I just thought that maybe since we spent the weekend at the MGM (3 rooms) pool parties, the fight, the clubs that out of courtesy MGM would pay the $12 it would cost to send me my watch free of charge but no. Its all about money and I will be taking my business to Luxor from now on! Thanks Jamila",0
"I did not like this restaurant at all.  Went for lunch, bill for 2 basic hamburgers, fries and drinks was over $30.  Quality was terrible.  Seemed like frozen hamburger fried in a skillet, fries were just basic.  Service was ok.  Not many people in the place and now I know why.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.",0
"After years of flat tires/various bike repairs and trips to bike shops all around the valley, I have to say this about Domenic's:\nThe lack of pretentious employees was so refreshing!\nPricing is fair!\nI walked right in on a Friday afternoon and got my bike back about an hour later.\nEveryone was so nice and helpful!\n\nI went to the Bike Cellar at the Transit Center to have them fix a really terribly loose pedal so they tightened the pieces and gave it back to me -- and then as I rode it out, the pedal went right back to the way it was. Last Friday I went into Domenic's to see if they could do a better job and I will say I was thrilled to get back on my bike this morning and have the pedal in better shape than I'd ever seen it. Like I said before, I got my bike back very promptly, and the service was great. \n\nI would definitely recommend Domenic's!",1
"Wow, I don't know where all these high ratings came from - I don't believe most of them are even real! Or at least, if they are real, they are for the doctor's office, not for the Med Spa section.\n\nThe staff here is the rudest I've encountered at any Med Spa in Las Vegas so far. I was 6 minutes late (seriously, 6 minutes!) and the girl behind the counter refused to check me in. She said it would mess up her schedule and she had a very busy day. She then told me I could call and reschedule - didn't even offer to reschedule me while I was there! I told her I had driven all the way from Henderson on the recommendation of a current client and this was my first time at the Med Spa. She got up and walked to the other side of the desk and started talking to another employee!\n\nEven worse, after all the, I used the restroom and it was dirty...that's disgusting! If a Med Spa can't even take out their restroom trash, you know they're not providing clean services anywhere else!\n\nRude and gross? There's way too many Med Spa's in Vegas to waste your time and money going to this one!",0
"This has been by far the best brunch buffet I have ever had! The line is extremely long, however it is worth the wait. It is really nice inside and it is really neat how there are different rooms that are like French style cottages. The food is great and it is very clean which is a surprise especially for a Buffet. The different stations all around the buffet are sectioned for different regions of France. The omelets are delicious as they are prepared right in front of you with what ever ingredient that you choose such as crisp veggies and different types of cheeses. The crapes are prepared the same way, you choose whatever you want in them such as fruit and cream. There are a wide selection of breakfast meats such as sausages, ham, and bacon. There are also waiters in hand to bring drinks (including alcoholic drinks) and assist with anything needed. The brunch buffet is kinda pricey, but is is well worth the money.",1
"I have stayed in many Fairmonts over the years.  This rates as a nice one.  Top staff and nice building.  It's newer as opposed to the old grande dame canadian resort legacy hotels.  good restaurants, staff, gym, spa and views!  Highly recommend if you end up in Pittsburgh!",1
"Been coming here since they opened... 3 years now?!  Terrific pizzas.  I pick one up for takeout about once a week, and you just can't go wrong.  Great vibe inside, and a perfect spot for a date.  Reasonable prices, too, considering the quality.  Really nice to see this place doing so well.",1
"Gimme a break, this is an imitation Mexican restaurant run by McDonalds.  I'm from Urbana and I live in a very competitive place for mexican food, San Diego, CA.  The best thing that can be said about the food is, (a) Its not expensive for the amount you get, (b) It's unlikely to cause indigestion, and (c) If you've never tried mexican before, this won't turn you away forever.\n\nOtherwise, compared to many other mexican fast-food restaurants, this one is highly forgettable.  \n\nExample : L.S. (CA West Coast), much better, a 5-star fast-food mexican restaurant.  \n\nExample : R. (National), much better, a little pricier than the one above and salsas not as good, a 4-star fast-food mexican restaurant, and a publically traded company.  \n\nExample : T.B. (National).  Ok, it's not really mexican, but I enjoy their \""""imaginary\"""" mexican creations, such as the 7-layer burrito and their chalupas, 3 stars.",0
"I've been here twice. Once for the Larry Fitzgerald celebrity softball game and the other for the recent Tim McGraw concert. The place overall is nice and they always have a lot of security and emergency personnel walking around which I like. In the summer it can get very hot, but if you've lived in the Phoenix area long enough you would know that. I'd definitely come back for future events.",1
Charged us $96 for a catfish after quoting price as $30 (still too much for the small gnarly fish we got).  All I could do was laugh and wish I had eaten on the strip.,0
"AWFUL!  AVOID!  I've had it with the overpriced buffets in Vegas.  Saturday and Sunday brunch price is not advertised on the website and you can't just buy breakfast on Saturday or Sunday.  So, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try because of all the great review, but no brunch buffet is $41.99 per person.  I'm not opposed to paying up for good food, but seriously, all I wanted was eggs, bacon and some toast.  Don't be a tourist.  \n\nThis place is designed by the same people who brought you the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan as evidenced by the posts that hold the ropes for the line.  Unfortunately, they don't have nearly the amount of space as the Wicked Spoon, so there's a ton of seating, but the buffet is crowded by the tables and people coming in.  In essence, you're cramped down to a single line along the buffet and with barely 25% of the seats in the place filled, there were long lines for the carved meat, seafood and omellete stations and there are only one of each.  \n\nMy girlfriend paid for brunch since I paid for dinner the night before, but from the moment my jaw dropped upon seeing the price - $90 and change for two people - things just kept getting worse.  We were first seated at a table which didn't have enough room to get into the second seat because it was crowded by a floor lamp.  They did move us, but I was extremely frustrated by this point.\n\nMimosas are included with the exorbitant price, so I ordered two and my girlfriend went to get food.  She had barely sat down when a child, obviously neglected by his parents, lobbed this little rubber handle they give you to pick up the metal dishes at the buffet at her, hitting her in the hair and then bouncing off her and landing right in the middle of the plate.  It was covered in BBQ sauce, so now she's go sauce in her hair and this thing right in the middle of the plate of food she'd just waited in three different lines to get.  Next, the 'owner' of the kid (I say that because he obviously had no parenting skills) starts mouthing off to us and which point I just started motioning for the wait staff or anybody else who attention I could get.  As much as I wanted to rip him limb from limb (he did quiet down a bit when I stood up and he realized I was 6'5\""""/300), it's better to let the hotel handle it and I figured this way my chance to get out of this awful experience and get our money back.  As the manager approached, he started mouthing off again, swearing, etc. and I just told the manager I wanted this awful experience to end.  She took us to the front which calling security on the guy with the kid and refunded our money.\n\nOverall, and awful experience.  They did solve the problem and we did get our money back, but the bottom line is it's just another buffet and at $41.99/person, you can go to a decent restaurant for breakfast twice, get better food and not have to deal with the idiot tourists.\n\nUpon leaving, we went to Crystal's at City Center and ended up having lunch at Wolfgang Puck's.  Yea, I know it's a chain and I've eaten at the one at O'Hare too many times, but the service was fantastic, the food was good as usual and the atmosphere was soooooo much better.",0

"Had dinner at Pio Pio a few weeks ago after reading rave reviews on Yelp and a few food blogs. The restaurant had a few other tables full when we arrived, a mix of couples, families, people dropping by for take out, and a Bring Me That delivery employee waiting for a delivery order. I ordered the 1/4 chicken white meat meal with rice, beans, and plantains. My husband got the 1/4 dark with yucca. Everything was great! The chicken was super flavorful, even bites without skin tasted like the marinade/seasonings they use. The rice, as many other reviewers have mentioned, is delicious - the saffron flavor is definitely noticeable, but not overpowering (I love saffron, so I was not surprised that the rice was one of my favorite parts of the meal -  a close second to the chicken.) The plantains and yucca sides were both great, too. We live nearby, so I'm sure we'll be dining in and picking up to go orders regularly.",1
I gave it 4 stars mainly because of the authenticity and coolness of the establishment. The food is made to order and spicy liked I asked! First time trying Ethiopian food and I liked it. Will be back again!!,1
"I use to love Rolands. However, the last few times we have been there it has been terrible.  While the food remains okay, the service leaves something to be desired.  Our waitress took longer than 15 minutes to come over and get our drink order; we had to get the hostess to find her.  She did not come back to the table for more than 20 minutes at a time.  The waitress was rude and less than helpful.  Our 1 drink and lunch took over two hours to complete.  Good thing they still have a good bloody mary.",0
"Great food, affordable prices.\n\nJust don't ask for the won ton chips if you're getting your food to go.  Unless you really want someone to tell you off.  Or if I'm there to watch.  It's pretty funny.",1
"I have been going here for years.  This place reminds me of the Mexican restaurants I used to go to as a kid in California.  Chips are Salsa are pretty good, but I am a big fan of their burritos...some of the best that I have had in the valley!",1
"$28 for a hamburger?  with potato chips?  That wasn't even good?  And took 45 minutes to come out?  And $2 extra for a slice of cheese, like really?  I mean do you know how many burger places there are in Vegas?\n\nWe had to ask the waitress where it was, when she went and checked on it, it had been under the warmer so long the plastic top to the ketchup was warped and starting to melt.  \n\nI also ordered a Mimosa, I got some fancy one that cost $20 a glass and had some blue stuff in it...and an edible flower?  I just wanted a plain Mimosa. \n\nThe waitress here might be pretty, but my Lord you can see them thinking...I mean smoke starts coming out of the ears like Femmebots. \n\nWith that stated, the best worker here was a guy who had some type of walking impediment. He deserves a 5 star rating. He was the only one working I swear!!   He needs a promotion. \n\nTerrible Service, Terrible Food",0
"Bland Bland Bland! Service was good but food and drinks (mojito) were bland!!! We went to have a date night at Casa Don Juan and sadly my husband and I were disappointed, coming from San Diego and spoiled by amazingly authentic Mexican food; nothing here had any flavor. From the salsa for the chips (it had heat) beans were bland and if you order a tamale, that is exactly what you get a steamed tamale with nothing and hardly any meat. My husband had the chimichanga platter and it was bland boiled chicken fried in a tortilla. The mojito taste like lime juice over ice... Very disappointing",0
"incredible experience.  most of the tapas were superb; a few were ok.  but the vibe, waitstaff, great tapas and wine motivate 5 stars.  i will 100% be back to this place during future vegas trips",1
"I think this place is OVER GRADED by other comments. It is not worth $40 buffet at all. It is just an ordinary buffet where you only pay $20. This is my first time eating buffet and I did not know what to eat after my first or second plate. There is nothing to pick or choose since they dont have many variety. There sushi is very veryyyyyyyy limited (california roll is all I can see) , no sashimi. King crab leg are cold , not HOT. Not much seafood to choose. \nthe Only reason I give them 1 star because they have very good lamb chop. That was all I ate that night since there was nothing else to eat. \n\nI think this place need to upgrade their menu or at least reduce the price if they dont want to lose more customers. Definitely I WILL NOT COME BACK HERE AGAIN for a long long time until I heard good change from them. \n\nThe worst buffet ever in Las Vegas, Rio or Bellagio is much better. Even Panda Express is way better food or $$$.",0
"I was not a fan of crossfit but a friend of mine talked me into trying it out. After a few workouts here, I was hooked. Such a great atmosphere with helpful and knowledgeable owners.

I am a nationally certified trainer and this box improved my fitness level beyond what I could do on my own. It is nice to have owners that know more about fitness than I do and invest in all their members becoming better.",1
"Service and staff were friendly and knowledgeble.... no wait....of course after experiencing the food it is easy to see why!\nI would say Los Olivos is 1 very short step up from Arribas.\nI started with a margarita $7.00 which was quite tasty...and I am still feeling the effects...lol...\nFish tacos were expensive $13.95 for 3, Boringgggggg and tasteless...*Yawn*\nGazpacho was again very boring and way too peppery.   \nThe salsas were just ok....  I think someone needs to learn about spices...\nThe tortilla chips were stale.\nDid I mention the Margartia was good? lol\nOne of the people at our table tried the guacomole and enjoyed it but did not care for the chili rellano.  And I must admit I did enjoy the frijoles...good texture and tasty....once you doust it with hot sauce.\nAnd so goes the search for some decent mexican food in North Scottsdale area that is affordable.\nWould I go back to this restaurant.......Naaaaaaaaah!\nBut the Margarita was yummy.....or did I say that already? lol\nIf it is generic mexican you are looking for with a \""""not so cheap\"""" price tag this might be an option for you.\nBon Appetite'",0
"this place is amazing - everything I could want in a bar (minus a dance floor, but if I wanna shake my ass I'll head to Charlies @ 2am for after hours...) often i find myself limited to self-proclaimed \""""gay bars\"""" in the phoenix area, which are nothing more than glorified dump/dive bars..but here i can go in with my friends and have a good time without scrutiny.\n\ngreat selection of beers, I experiment and try a new one every time i go..fin du monde is a favorite of mine, as well as boddingtons...i'm becoming quite the beer connaisseur...i don't drink wine, so i really couldn't tell you much about the wine list but i've looked at it and it seems quite impressive.\n\nthe bartenders are great, knowledgeable and friendly...they had a live dj last night which made it uber cool, otherwise they just have a playlist going, always filled with fucking amazing music that i swore they stole from me..\n\nthe atmosphere is great, comfortable, intimate, cozy. take a date here to get comfortable with them...\n\ndef one of my favorite bars in phoenix.",1
"I am from Harrisburg, PA, about an hour or so drive from Philly.  This is the absolute closest I have tasted to an actual Philadelphia cheese steak.  My husband and I love this place.  The guys I work with also now love this place.  The workers are friendly and glad you came in.   The steak sandwich - perfect, the bun is great, mine is always steak, muchrooms and cheese.  My husband perfers the works the largest they have.  The fries are great, just as everyone else has said.  I would definately recommend this place to everyone.  Oh, that's right I already have, remember I mentioned my work.  We cant eat here enough.",1
"I come to PHX regularly but this was my first time staying in Tempe.  This was our conference hotel so I stayed in a pretty standard room for $200ish a night.  They tag on a hospitality fee to bring it up to around $200-ish and this gives you free WiFi and access to the hotel shuttle.\n\nThe downside is that if you arrive outside of shuttle hours (ends at 10:30 pm so not great for late arrivals), you're still stuck paying the fee and have to cab it over for about $20 bucks including tip.\n\nThat being said, the rooms are clean and a decent size with flat screen TVs and decent staff.  Bed linens are average and the bathroom is average.\n\nSuper convenient location since you're a few steps from the restaurants and shops on Mill Ave... The downside is that Mill Ave is totally the university student hangout at night so there's a ton of drunk people wandering around and it's loud... I had a light to moderate amount of music/noises since my room was facing the bars... I slept fine, but if you're a light sleeper, I would specially mention it at check-in.\n\nDidn't use the gym since the weather's pretty much perfect right now (high 70s, low 80s) and super close to a great running path along Tempe  Lake.\n\nWould stay again here if I had to be in Tempe, but I would ask for a quieter room.",1
"My sister and I came here in October, during our b-day week. I went with the tip to come early, around 5:00pm, which turned out perfectly, not wait at all. I enjoyed the food immensely. The only thing was we were so early, that some of the seafood, the crab legs most noticably, were still partially frozen. Honestly, though, and what you need to save the most room for, is dessert! This place has the BEST desserts of any buffet I've ever been to. And the best is that they serve them all in these little portions, so you can try a TON of them. They also have gelato, a very good selection, but the regular desserts were my favorite. They had two kids of trifle, this fudgy kind of chocolate cake, carrot cake muffins, a kiwi mousse. I mean it was endless, so good!\n\np.s. I wouldn't even bother with the lobster tails though, tiny and tasteless. Stick to the crab legs and then dessert!",1
"Most dissatisfying hair-cutting experience ever. Went in asking for a long and typical layered look but came out with a short, blunt and jagged cut. Pino speaks very highly of himself and his work but in actuality the service he provided was the opposite. I will not be returning nor would I recommend anyone else to do so either.",0
"Spinach Tortellini with alfredo sauce was quite delicious, as well as the Four Cheese Pizza.  Cheese on this pizza was quite thick, almost a chore to cut and serve with the spatula.  Crust is golden, chewy overall, and rather medium in thickness.\n\nClean & new place with newer furniture, and plenty of round tables.  Server was prompt and polite, and was helpful with menu selections.  Prices were fair.\n\nI wish the tables were bigger.  The little round ones are simply inadequate for 4 people, and really the pizza should be served on one of those elevated pizza holders.  There's just no room.  Draft selection was poor as well with Anheuser-Busch/InBev products only.\n\nNice quiet lunch spot on weekdays.",1
"For those of you who wants to see what kind of seafood is served at Village Seafood Buffet at Rio. I have recorded an extended steady tour of the whole buffet stations:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYl2MEs5bjI\n\nThe Village Seafood Buffet is located at the other end of the casino floor. \n\nThe lines could get very long between 7 and 8pm. \n\nAs for me, I got there around 7:30 on a Thursday evening and waited about 20 minutes. The price for dinner was $45, so about $15 more than Carnival World Buffet.\n\nThere were a lot of seafood options to choose from as you can see from my video.\n\nTo be honest, I really went there for the AYCE lobster, I was hugely disappointed that it was so freaking tiny (see video). They didn't serve Maine lobster instead they served Rock lobster. If you guys don't know, Rock lobsters come from the Pacific ocean and has no claws, whereas Maine Lobsters come from the East coast with claws. Anyways, I still ate a whole bunch of tiny-halved lobster tails to ensure that I got my money worth.\n\nThey serve a lot of clams, mussels, and crawfish that are not served at Carnival World Buffet.\n\nOverall the food was good not great. I believe this is the only place in Vegas that serve AYCE lobster.\n\nLike I said before, to decide if you guys want to eat here, I have recorded a full steady tour of the Village Seafood Buffet for all of you guys to enjoy!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYl2MEs5bjI",1

"This food cart is awesome! I typically am not a big fan of Mediterranean food but the falafels were so perfectly fried and the sauces perfect (my favorite is tahini), that this is one of the most perfect lunch choice at Library Mall. Everything is cooked to perfection, but I would definitely recommend getting the falafel rather than anything else, because seriously, the fried chickpeas is supremely perfect, with just the right amount of spices. Mmmm makes me hungry just thinking about it! I wish I were a student again so I can get this every week. Perfect for a quick lunch between classes/student jobs.",1
The best hot yoga spot in town!!!!! This place has a great energy and amazing instructors...,1

"I took the advice of a friend and stuck with safe menu choices. Steak wasn't bad. Went back for lunch (Im staying two blocks away) and had very boring salmon and pasta.  Mediocre wine overpriced. Only bother to return at lunch cos it's too cold to walk further. \nHad stuffed cod....not bad, but tiny.\nWish DISH were open for lunch.",0
"Man I used to love this place when it it was a quaint, affordable Cajun place with snazzy music and really interest atmosphere.  But over the years, the music changed, the decorations got taken down, and the menu went from awesome to not so impressive.  The food is also French or something Nus dye to the new changes to the menu.  Even with a BOGO coupon, it wasn't worth it to eat at the current Mimis Cafe.  The only saving grace its the fantastical carrot raisin loaf and clam chowder Fridays.",0
"The upside to staying at Vdara is the wonderful room layout. King size bed, large bathroom with a tub deep enough to make a hot tub, queen size pullout couch (very comfortable) and full kitchen with stove, fridge and any cookware you ask for. It's also non-smoking which is nice to walk into after walking through all of the other smoking hotels. All for $149! \n\nThe downsides to staying there are the pool area and their customer service. The pool area itself is setup nicely with private cabanas, HOT sun and a great staff. However, this was completely overshadowed as the pool area was covered in green bugs and they were all over the guests unless we were in the water. This happened this past Friday morning on 4/16/10. We could only last for about 20 minutes in the water and without being able to sit around the pool we left. We tried going to Aria, which when I emailed guest services before I arrived said we would have free access to Aria's pool, but was denied access when we got there. This left us no option for a pool, which if anyone that goes to Vegas knows is pretty much the best part of the trip. Thank god we only booked Vdara for the first night and the MGM Grand the last two. We promptly went to get our things and check out of Vdara. When I checked out they asked if I was unsatisfied with anything during my stay. I mentioned the bug problem and the fact that guest services had lied to me (and I have the email to prove it) and the employee didn't really seem to care. So we hustled over to MGM and guess what...no bugs anywhere! I think Vdara's problem is the trees they planted on the third floor pool deck which seemed to be where the bugs were coming from. \n\nI would say the pool and guest services issues would warrant three stars since going to Vegas is about being pampered and there's no reason why someone should have to be disappointed in Vegas, but it goes on. I received an on-line survey regarding my stay after I checked out and I wrote out the issues we had with our stay. The survey asked if I wanted to be contacted by a Vdara representative regarding my stay and I requested to be contacted by telephone. It's been well over a week now and still no call. I mean it's one thing to not care, if you are Vdara, because people will probably stay there anyway since it is the new City Center, but don't send me a survey and say you are going to contact me and then not contact me. It's similar to a company giving employees a satisfaction survey and the company keeps the results for themselves so as to not communicate any discontent employees may have. It's just bad business.",0
"Chipotle is one of my favorites but I will be driving to the Goodyear location from now on. We live half way between the Buckeye location and the Goodyear location and normally drive to Buckeye just because the parking is better than at the Goodyear restaurant. Last Saturday, around 11:30am we drove to Buckeye to enjoy a Chicken Burrito.\n\nWhen we arrived and walked in, the music was so loud I had to squint as it was bothersome. We walked to the counter and attempted to order and we couldn't hear the guy behind the counter because the music was so loud. Luckily we knew what he was asking since we eat Chipotle so often.\n\nWe got our food and sat down and my wife said, \""""this music is way too loud and giving me a headache\"""". We couldn't hear one another talking and had to yell to speak to one another. We cut our lunch short and left because the music was so loud and bothersome. It wasn't pleasing background music but more rock music that was at the volume you would find at a concert.\n\nWe looked around and watched the other customers trying to have conversations and they were all leaning across the table and yelling to try and hear one another.\n\nVery unpleasant experience and we'll find another place from now on.",0
"Very disappointing taste... Presentation of dishes is very bad... Ambience is Ok... Service is average...\n\nThis is in comparison to so many indian restaurants we ate in US.\nDine date : 2012Feb10\nHope they improve it soon.\n\nFull Details below:\n4 of us went, 2 vegetarians and 2 non-vegetarians\nPakoda - Made of only Potato not cut properly. Generally we expect Onion/Gobi.\n\nChicken Tikka - Tastes good, juicy and nicely marinated. Lacks presentation. The onions provided are not seasoned and are White Onions. Specifically order for more spicy(hot) but we got it very less spicy dish.\n\nChicken Biryani - Specifically ordered for less spicy and its too spicy(hot). Has lot of peas and less chicken. No coriander added. Chicken is well cooked but the dish lacks many ingredients. Doesn't feel like a biryani.\n\nMutton Biryani - Specifically ordered for less spicy and I was sweating heavily by the time I left. Again too many peas and less Mutton. Mutton is tender and cooked well, but the dish as such does not have that biryani taste.\n\nVegetable Biryani - Except for Potato and Peas, there are no more vegetables. C'mon... at the least we expect a couple of Gobi and carrot pieces. \n\nThe side of Raita provided is horrible. There are no cut onions/tomato/coriander/green chili in it. Its plane yogurt mixed with lots of water.\n\nDal Makhani - Nice taste and proper quantity.\n\nBasmati Rice - Not properly cooked. Is cooking plane rice so hard..??\n\nSoft drinks - they do refill it, but the soda doesn't have proper soda in it.... its like as if  you leave a coke bottle open for 1/2 hour and drink it.\n\nPricing - Reasonable and equivalent to other Indian restaurants. \n\nService - Good. The waitress is very presentable, doesn't bother to give us choices. Also doesn't bother to tell our specific needs to the cook. Seriously..?? I can have that in a buffet or in a fast food joint..\n\nFinally my friend giving us the treat, decided he will take us to a better restaurant again. Everyones disappointed.",0
"I really really was hoping to give this place a great rating, but I am unable to. Whoever says these burgers taste like White Castle, has obviously never had a \""""Real White Castle Burger'. Even though they were cooked fresh, they tasted old. The Red Velvet Birthday Cake really gives you the \""""Birthday Feeling\"""" as it tasted like melted wax candle. Not sure if they use a cream cheese base frosting, but it tasted kinda off. Everyone is different, and you may like it. I for one, will not be going back. Time to bust out the tums.

Please save your FACE and yourself major aggravation.",0
excellent donuts I was pleasantly surprised! I'll be back!,1
"This place is really cute and all, but I did not leave dinner feeling impressed. The steak was talked up before we came here and reviews said it wasn't bad either. I've had my share of amazing steaks and this was SO disappointing. It was $35 for the filet mignon au poivre and I would much rather have spent my money elsewhere. I could have paid ten more dollars and gotten myself a fantastic steak elsewhere.\n\nI ordered my steak medium rare and it was cooked okay. My biggest gripe: it was COVERED in sauce. All it said on the menu was that it came with creme fraiche (which it did) but it was swimming in sauce. It was so overpowering that it ruined the meal. Another girl at the table got the same thing and had the same feelings. Sauce was so overpowering. Good steaks don't really need anything other than a decent rub on the outside. I felt the meat was a bit low on flavor otherwise. You can sub the fries for mashed potatoes or another side for $1.95 more. \n\nThe sangria was good. They say it can serve 4, but really, it can serve 5. We also tried the chicken liver mousse. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. \n\nOverall, it was a cute place, but that's pretty much it for me. It is on the cheaper side for Vegas considering the atmosphere, but if you are in the mood for steak, look elsewhere. That extra $10 will really get you something 100  times better. We also initially had reservations for 6, but had a last minute cancellation, and they still automatically added in the 18% gratuity that is for parties of 6 or more? Not cool.\n\nNote: Patio seating is on a first come, first serve basis. Reservations are only good for inside seating and your whole party must be present to be seated.",0
"I was so excited to have a new spot in NoDa and a sushi place at that. The restaurant is ideally located and looks amazing. Our waiter was very friendly and did the best he could but the food was pretty awful. \n\nWe ordered edamame as our appetizer and it took more than 15 minutes to come out. When it did, it was covered in a buttery substance and was terrible. \n\nThe calamari was all batter and very little calamari which the waiter confirmed as a common complaint. The spring rolls tasted like something I could have gotten out of my freezer and made at home. There was a roll called Fresh and something that was actually pretty good. It was the lone highlight of the meal. Well that and the wine!\n\nHopefully they can work some kinks out and stick around...",0

"A cute outdoor mall with a great selection of eateries, shops, and entertainment. There is a main island that you can walk around, which has shops, restaurants, etc., then there are rows of stores on the outskirts of \""""the island.\"""" So if you're on the island looking for a store or restaurant & you don't see it on the main island, check the directory. You will likely want to drive to stores outside of the main island.  (Was that confusing?)  The island mostly hosts clothing stores for tween - 20s (think Hollister, Xi, & Hot Topic).\n\nThe AMC movie theatre used to be my main reason for coming, but there's also Yard House, which is one of my favorite restaurants in that area. They have a nice Barnes & Noble, and D&B is in that main part as well. \n\nIn the summers that have rows of misters lined up along the storefronts to keep (try to) you cool. That water center (a small area where small doses of water spout up from the ground) is popular amongst the tykes. \nDuring the cooler months, near that same center, is a huge enclosed fire-pit. I love that thing!\n\nThe have another area with a stage and a large screen, which is usually playing a music video of some sort. They have events throughout the year, which are advertised in the Scottsdale mailers, so I assume they are advertised in N. Phoenix and other bordering areas as well.  Otherwise, if you're at the mall, they have a calendar if events posted. (I'm sure it's probably on their website as well.)\n\nAmple parking. Well lit at night.

"I'm almost always up for trying bbq, so when I was in the neighborhood passing by Famous Dave's, I had to listen to the inner voice. As others have said, it's a bit corporate and contrived.

(People will either love or hate standouts, so better business to aim for the middle of the road.)\n\nOverall, Dave's is good in a mediocre sort of way. Coming here, odds are you will have a nice experience and some decent food. Sometimes, when you're not sure what you're in the mood for, a place like Famous Dave's can be the answer.",0
"The worst carls jr. I have been to in the Pacific time Zone.  Welcome to whale-burger. \n\nThe service is slow and my food was cold.  If I wanted to reheat my food I would've bought it yesterday!  In the drive-thru there was only one car before our 3burger and 2side order, order and it took longer than 15mins because there was an issue with their order and the Carl's jr operator had to explain the situation to the other fat-neck turkeylegged-forearm smoking female customer why changing her order at the drive-thru window takes longer.  Hurry the famous-star up you double patty neck thickburger. Carl's jr operator, make that beached whale pull her smoking blowhole around so other people can get their already made food that's already sitting there getting cold which is all ready to be paid for and eaten.  There is a drive-thru line waiting to poach that humpback Honda accord and sell her to the Spring Mountain markets of Chinatown.  People are starving !\n\nAfter expressing my displeasure, they acknowledged their mistake and tried to rectify the situation by offering a free drink and a cookie and then asked if we wanted any condiments and we requested ketchup and ranch for the fried zucchini.  Still displeased by being nurtured with sweets for our time from sitting in a \""""fast food drive-thru\"""" we paid form our cold food and drive three major streets over home to eat our food.  \n\nThe fried zucchini was cold and I had to put it in the oven.  The burgers were smashed and slopped together in such inattentive mess that there was sauce all over the wrapper coating the outside buns of the cold burgers.  As if the Carls jr food assembly line took their frustration out on the successive cars who's only crime was paying for food behind a bad customer's poor order.   The food literally looked like garbage.  Pieces of lettuce soaked in condiments sliding around inside a wrapper slapped together with squished tomatoes and a smashed bun made the food very unappealing to taste.   The only thing that wasn't cold was my shake which melted from waiting and is now sitting in my freezer to be frozen again.",0
"Came here for lunch after a long night of partying.  I'm a huge fan of French food, and had definitely been craving it ever since I arrived at PH and saw that the Paris was next door.  Mon Ami Gabi definitely satisfied my craving!  A friend and I split the steak classique (steak with butter), and the quiche Lorraine.  So good!!!  The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare, as requested.  The quiche Lorraine was delicious, but I was so full by the time I got around to eating it that I only had a few bites; what I did eat was perfectly balanced.  My friends seemed to enjoy their orders as well.  I only wish that the restaurant served steak tartare... I would've been on that like white on rice!\n\nSide note, the bread is served warm and crusty, the way it should be.  I wanted to eat the whole baguette myself, not to lie... but highly disappointing was the cold butter! \n\nDefinitely worth coming here for a meal that is nice, but not too nice (I'm looking at you, 16-course tasting menu at JG), when you're in Vegas.",1
"On February 27th, I let my younger sister Ariel drive my girl (truck) to school. Sadly for me and my girl it was raining outside.

Luckily for us, one of the other drivers involved in the accident recommended me to Metropolitan Auto Body. I called and they arranged a tow truck and rental car to come & get me out of there. Upon arrival, the rental car was there and I got to meet the manager who gave an estimate quote. After 4 days of them working on the front of my girl, I got my girl back looking like new. They also helped me adding two more fog lights. \n\nI would like to thank everyone at Metropolitan Auto Body for helping us through this stressful time... THANK YOU!",1
Love the good egg! Been going for about ten years and this our new fav location. Dependable deliciousness by friendly staff. Yay!,1
"We stayed in Madison Lakes rooms, it was beautiful - modern, comfortable, very well put together.  Being dog friendly was a great treat and we got to bring our 4 legged friend with us, who loved the stay.  The property is wonderful and the owners incredibly nice.  Breakfast was really great, a wonderful way to start the day.  The only reason I give 4 and not 5 stars is that it is somewhat close to the highway, which detracts from the tranquil nature of the property, though not enough to prevent me from staying again.",1
"My home is 1300 sq. feet.  I decided I wanted my entire home in laminate flooring.  I called Empire because they were having a 60% off special and their ads boasts next-day installation.  The rep that came to my house was very nice and professional.  However, after measuring the floor she informed us it would cost a whopping $13,000!  This amount was way over budget, especially for a no-name brand of flooring.  Plus, we had already removed the previous flooring and base boards so all we needed was product and installation.  Naturally, we declined and the sales rep was polite an left us her card.\n\nWe ended up going with Lowe's who had a .99 cent per square foot installation on Pergo and Armstrong laminate flooring.  Today makes 2 weeks since we ordered our Pergo flooring and it is just want I wanted!  Out the door, we paid 7k for product, taxes, delivery, and installation.  Although it wasn't next-day installation, it was worth the wait to save $6,000!",0
This company should be shut down. They refused to place my order and still took money out of my account. Now they will not put it back into my account. Everybody who you speak to on their phone lines are in their home.,0
"We love this place. Locally owned where the Frank of Frank & Finas  waits tables and ensures guests are happy with the food and service. We had a carne asada burrito and a chicken special. Both were delicious. The salsa has a very nice flavor and the chips are thin and crispy. Overall, a great meal and very affordable. Nice job!",1
"We order delivery to our nearby office building several times per week. The food is fair to good and the delivery is typically pretty fast. \nTip 1: call or walk-in before 11am to order breakfast items such as an omelet, however they are strict about not allowing a substitution for fruit instead of hash browns. \nTip 2: the baja grilled chicken wrap is excellent and a healthy choice if you omit the cheese and request a wheat wrap (warning this wrap contains just the right amount of  jalapenos..but be sure to have something to drink close by)\nA few times I've called when the delivery order was wrong (eg received the buffalo grilled wrap instead of the baja - there's a big difference in taste!) and each time I called to tell them about the mistake, there was a  skeptical \""""tone\"""" in her voice (the owner?) and clearly not a sincere apology - the impression she gave was that they were doing us a favor by fixing or replacing it... \nBut they do a good enough job for something quick and close-by, and the delivery option is a blessing in this area. They have a nice little area to dine inside at the cafe when time permits, and several outdoor tables with umbrellas to sit at on nice-weather days.",0
"I really like Graze. I've been a couple times now - once for dinner and once for drinks - and both times I was impressed by their excellent service. Oh, and the view of the capitol is AWESOME! Prices are just fine, especially for such a swanky-feeling place. I go here when I want to feel fancy but don't want to feel broke afterward. It's classy but quite down to earth - a good combo.\n\nThe only thing is that I actually haven't been super impressed with is their food. When I went for dinner, my companion and I both agreed that our dishes weren't really anything special. I will probably return to confirm - maybe it was just what we ordered. \n\nBut for drinks, I would say that if you're entertaining guests to Madison, this would be the spot to go.",1
"Stumbled upon this place a while back and was pleasantly surprised.  It's a small clean place that seemed a bit unassuming, but friends and I decided to stop in.  Boy I'm glad we did!  the carrot juice was great, always love a place that offers ginger beer, and the brown chicken stew was sooooo good.  Wish I had room for dessert, but I was pretty stuffed by the end.  \n\nOne thing I don't recommend is the plantain and avocado spring rolls.  It just becomes a strange flavorless mush in your mouth.  But don't let that dissuade you from trying this place out, because then you'd be missing out.",1
"I met a friend at Lola Coffee last week for First Friday but I didn't have any time to spend inside the place.  Oh how I now regret not showing up an hour earlier!  I went back yesterday to experience what Lola had to offer.  I sooooo dug on this place!!  For me this place has some of what I miss about the Bay Area and Sacramento.  It's a great coffeehouse on a busy street in a vibrant part of the city.  I couldn't name all the cool tunes I heard playing over the audio system but I'm pretty sure there was some Depeche Mode (and I'm a product of the 80s/90s).  I had myself a double mocha with whipped cream.  The whipped cream was one of the best decisions I've made in a week.  You see, some dairy alchemist decided to infuse the whipped cream with some vanilla and espresso.  All I have to say about that is if the whipped cream spun it would be called DJ YummyTron!!!  So I sat down and chilled flipping through an interior design book with a forward by Joely Fisher and sipping on my mocha (I later moved on to reading an issue of NY Times Magazine talking about people who worry a lot).  I soon became distracted by the light-rail going by and a bunch of old cars roaring up and down the street (not gonna lie to you, there was some eye-candy of the femme variety in the place too).  I soon came to absolutely treasure the huge window fronting Central Ave.  Only downside was I don't have a laptop so I couldn't be one of the cool kids surfing the web while sipping my drink.  They had a woman come in and put together some floral arrangements which I thought was a nice touch (and I told them as much).  Go, sip, listen, watch, and enjoy!!!",1
"After a long day at the pool and 10 shots of Petron, we decided to get some steaks. ENVY came highly recommended by one of our friends. He didn't even bother to hype up the steaks cuz apparently ENVY's claim to fame are their truffle fries. ENVY definitely came through. \n\nSurrounded by dudes that can flat out eat, we had three orders of 19 oz bone-in rib eyes, three orders of truffle fries, a sampler, four orders of soup, and bacon mac and cheese. I think we consumed a whole cow over dinner. The food was absolutely amazing. I also need to send a special shout out to the watress for continously filling my plate with the macadamia sweet bread.\n\nThe food was reasonably priced and the place had a very comforting ambiance. It's nice to get some peace and quiet for a minute since the hotel is off the strip. Look for valet guy Wayne on your way out of the hotel. Dude has the key to a lot of Vegas hot spots. \n\nFYI - Apparently there is a huge discount coupon floating around online. I've yet to find it. Blah!",1
"I am about to share a couple of personal comments on the pizza. This doesn't mean I'm complaining. I did give it 4 stars after all. It was a great lunch for my son and I. Also I walked into the door of my house holding leftovers and ate another piece. I'm not certain if this is a matter of my bad habits or the great taste of their pizza.\n\nI'd say that the crust is a little too sweet. The sauce is a bit acidic like I can feel the heartburn coming on. At least it's not that slap your tastebuds around nasty tang stuff. It's a good NY tomato tasting sauce.\n\nThe lady that works there is nothing like my mom, but she is so sweet I wish my mom were more like her. My 7 year old son loved the place, but that would explain why he was the one who recommended it.",1
"I used to work for Vons for 8 years. I went through many service training classes and used to be a manager, so I know a little about service. I have been in this particular store a few times and the service is far from great. Ive also called this location to ask a simple question and got even worse service over the phone from the clerk at the \""""customer service desk\""""? I'm not one to yelp or complain a lot, but this place needs to re-evaluate it's training in service.",0
"I love Wong's.  My wife and I wanted to try something new and we felt like Chinese food so I looked at some reviews and we decided to give this place a try.  When pulling up to it we were a little skeptical because it is located in an older strip mall, and we both are picky when it comes to Chinese food.  We went in anyway and we are glad we did.  We have gone back a couple of time a month since.  We always get soup (I get the Hot and Sour and my wife gets the Wonton) and Crab Cheese Puffs(absolutely awesome tasting.  For the main meal we usually share the Sesame Chicken(portion sizes a big enough to share and we still take some home.  If my brother goes with us we get the Orange Beef too and that is really good.  I would get that more often but my wife does not like any spice in her food.  The restaurant its self is never very busy which is too bad because it makes our top 3 Chinese Restaurants that we have gone too.  The service is always pretty good and the part that makes me laugh when ever we go there is the lady who fills up the water is constantly filling our glasses no matter how much drink is left. :)  Way to go Wong's I just wish more people would give you a try.",1
"Very upset at this location. I work across the street and went on my lunch break. I spent 45 minutes in the drive thru and they really didn't even have a line. once I finally got to the window, I paid, then sat for 15 minutes. I actually watched them put my food together 3 minutes after I arrived at the window. The girl at the window disappeared , and I finally found her dancing in the back of the store. There must have been at least 10 crew members inside the kitchen and it took 5 minutes just to wave someone down. When I finally got someone to speak to me I told them the situation and all I got was an attitude. Not even a sorry for the wait. Then practically got my food thrown at me. When I asked the girls name that was supposed to be at the window the guy shut the window. And said bye. it's ridiculous how rude these kids were. I've been in fast food, I know it sucks but they should have at least some sort of customer service or shit.. Common sense.!!!!",0
"I know it's a restaurant targeted at large parties, so I'd imagine they'd hire waitstaff that know how to handle larger parties (or at least train 'em to).\n\nOur waitress consistently forgot about portions of our order, like a water for one of our 8 people (though everyone else had a water at that point). The kitchen staff actually brought the limes she requested out before the water arrived, probably 10 minutes after our drink order. The second pitcher of beer we ordered after appetizers didn't arrive until after we were finished with the dinner portion. I could go on, but you get the point.\n\nService was really slow, and it was hot and musty in our section. For a party of 8, 2 hours on a Sunday evening is pretty rough. The kitchen wasn't behind, we just sat with empty plates for a good 30-45 minutes after our meal.\n\nGood food ruined by the lack of service. Too bad.",0
"I have been coming to this salon since it opened and I received a coupon in the mail. As I have moved throughout the area, I always come back. I have tried other salons near where I'm living and they are never as good as this. You don't leave without perfection on your nails. \n\nThey are very nice and remember you from visit to visit. Even if I don't come for a few months, they remember me! Sometimes they get busy and I really don't think it matters if you have an appointment or not for just a mani or pedi. They take people as they come, but that works for me because I don't do well with schedules as mine is always crazy. \n\nI will bring any friends or out of town visitors only to this salon because I know they will be treated well and have great nails. They give a great discount for cash, which is awesome. I have never had a salon do that before and it's almost enough to cover the tip. I always tip more though because these ladies are the best! The atmosphere has changed a little since the men have started working there, but it will take time to get used to men LOL\n\nThey are very clean and I've never had a problem. Very reasonably priced. Designs are extra, but worth it. They do an amazing job and do any design you want.",1
"Ate dinner here a week ago.  They advertised a free buffet for happy hour but turns out it is nothing more than chips and salsa.   They also have a fruit platter but who is going to eat that with the cantaloupe killing so many people. When we saw the \""""Buffet\"""" we decided to try dinner.  Did not like the food. Just a tiny step above fast food.  The side dish was sone kind of noodles but they were cut up in about 1 inch pieces.  The beans were mashed and I almost gagged on them.  The chile relleno was the best part of the meal but still not up to par with the Barrio Cafe,  I do not plan on going back here again.  Can't believe their quality of food since they are located in a high class neighborhood.\nTheir adsvertising photos below are terrible.  Photgrapher used very bad lighting and it shows.",0
"They gave me a container full of old grease and scum. Aka yellow curry. I had high hopes for this place, but was sadly disappointed\n The chili chicken lunch special was ok but was missing one key ingredient CHiLI!!!",0
"Good wings. Bad pizza. Poor setting. Don't waste your time, go to Tony Sacco's or Lorenzo's pizza instead to get your fix. The strip mall is in a nice area so has potential but there are much better options available.",0

"I only recently discovered the make-your-own pizza concept at home, and was happy to see it in Vegas. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and the food was great. \n\nI ordered a #5 (olive oil, mozzarella, ricotta, gorgonzola, Parmesan, black pepper, garlic, fresh basil), and added caramelized onions. I LOVED the onions--sweet and added so much flavor. \n\n$12 for a personal pizza (if you're a person with a large-ish appetite) is a bit steep, but not surprising for Vegas. \n\nI wish they were open a bit later.",1
"This is the second time at Arizona Hichman, I was first sent there because of problems with the used hitch and trailer that I bought.  It had a load leveling system.  I returned today, with no appointment.  I could not drop my trailer, the hitch would not release.\n\nThey were very busy, all bays were full and several trailers were in their driveway being or waiting to be worked on.  I was desperate, I can not park my camper on the street more then 12 hrs, I needed my truck.  They told me to park it behind the restaurant, they would take care of it and fit it in.  I waited most of the afternoon, but they did the job.  When I got to the storage lot I had no problem disconnect.  I am so happy and great full that they took the extra time and fixed my problem.  This makes very loyal customers.",1
"If you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night, go to Sing Sing :) If you send a dollar up with a song request, they will play it. If they don't know it, they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like, or they will look up the lyrics and sing it!! They aim to please :) I have definitely been pleased :)",1
"We went in a group of 6 for their Saturday lunch buffet. The vegetarian dishes were pretty good- saag paneer, paneer matar, daal, rice, etc. The non veg weren't that good except for the chicken tikka. Idlis tasted like they were microwaved from having prepared them a few days ago. Sambar wasn't too bad. The Gulab jamoon was OK, hard to cut with a spoon. \nOverall, it was OK considering it is one of the very few Indian food options on the strip",0
"Having worked on Mill Ave for 7 years, my co-workers and I have frequented Bison Witches for lunch on many occassions but stopped because service was generally too slow for your standard work day lunch hour.  \n\nA group of us made it the site of a recent happy hour and will never return for many reasons - none of which had anything to do with the beer selection or food. \n\nThe service was terrible - and it wasn't even a busy night, in fact we were the majority of the bar patrons.  Not only was it difficult to get a drink (bartender too busy texting - with three or four of them behind the bar serving) we were yelled at by the servers for standing by the bar.  Granted if we'd been blocking the ONLY way through, I could understand needing to ask us to move - but when there was plenty of space to pass through to deliver trays to tables and using profanity to do so was absolutely inappropriate.  Again, our group comprised a majority of the bar business at that time of the evening.\n\nFood isn't that great, there are other places with equally good if not better beer selections and MUCH better, faster, nicer service.\n\nPOST EDIT: I wanted to update this revie to reflect that the owner of Bison Witches has since contacted me and extended a very gracious apology for the events that occured.  He handled it very well and dealt with the employee in question.  I greatly appreciated him taking the time and responding in a very timely manner - I certain believe this will make me give them a second look next time we're in the market for a happy hour location!  Thanks!",0
"I love the Valley Ho! It's a beautiful property with great rooms, a fantastic pool, an excellent restaurant -- Trader Vic's and a really nice spa. Be sure to stay in the newly re-modeled Loft Suite. It's two stories and it's fantastic! If I was to take a stay-cation, I would be sure to stay at the Valley Ho!

"a lot of good foodie friends recommend us to try Wynn buffet, it's rated in their top 3 Vegas buffets, so we decided to give it a try. What a disappointment, maybe we went in with high expectation, maybe we were just mad that we gave up our one night in Vegas to Wynn instead of Bacchanal.. nonetheless, the Buffet doesn't taste like it's worth the $40 price tag. We felt like we were paying $40 for Golden Corral type of food.\nThe selection on Saturday dinner were very limited, how can they call a Chinese station with only Chow mien, fried rice and some steamed dumplings? and a sushi station with 3 sorry type of California roll looking thing? They were missing the basics?? and Italian station had 4 different pastas but tasted the same. I don't know man, and the taste wasn't that great either. half of dessert section were candy apples.. err.. anyway, just don't think it's worth $40, not even close.. I had much better buffet for half of that price before.",0
"Okay, so this was the first time I have went to Zipp's and have heard mixed reviews but I still wanted to check it out for myself. I'm not one of those people who hear that a movie is bad and because they do so I avoid. Definitely not me! \n\nSo I decided to check it out around 2:45pm, I walked in and chose my seat way in the back. As the waitress arrived I asked for a water and soon got a water and a diet coke which I did not ask for. I had to say as she was asking me about appetizers that I only ordered a water, she did kindly take the diet coke away and didn't say anything after about getting the drinks wrong. \n\nWhen she returned I was ready for my order which was a Green bay cup of chili and an order of the tacos where I got 2 of the beef and 2 of the chicken. They asked if I wanted the chili first and of course I said yes.\n\nOkay, so my chili came to the table and I was sadly disappointed. It looked as though the bowl was already touched and the taste was just heat. It might look like a pretty picture to the eyes but I honestly had it and could only taste 'heat' from whatever spice they used, but no flavor. I was very disappointed as I thought there was going to be 'green chilis' as the description I read had on it as well as hey, this will actually have flavor!!\n\nBeyond that lets move on, I got the tacos where I decided to get 2 beef and 2 chicken, what should be so wrong with that right? Well, if I could be modest well wow, the portion size was great for the price, but beyond that, not worth it at all.\n\nThis is my honest opinion because these all were can I say, awful! I had one of the Chicken tacos and had to squeeze the grease out to eat it and it was kinda okay because of the sour cream and tomatoes to mask the flavor. When I got to the beef taco cause I wanted to mix it up, I again squeezed it because of all the grease and took a bite and could not taste anything. I took another bite and I could taste a hint of cleaner, this is not good and I was done. I did not know how long ago they changed there grease in the greaser and tasting a hint of cleaner I felt they did not care about me at all!\n\nI still had 1 chicken taco and a beef taco and I decided to give the chicken 1 more shot. I did not have any utencils but I decided to try it straight out of my hand and what I got was that canned chicken that I could buy out of the store. It had a tuna taste and just not cooked here kinda vibe. It was not good and honestly I have heard so much and would of hoped for more but deeply disappointed! \n\nI would not recommend this place for the service but if you are looking for greasy foods as you drink and you don't pay attention to taste then this may be for you.",0
Don't let the one star fool you.  Food is great but I've been to a few Cafe Rio's and they all have great food. They all are consistently good. \n\nThis Cafe Rio in particular is horrible.  They have horrible service.  Every time I go I consistently order $50 - $60 of food.  They have screwed up my order EVERYTIME.,0
"I should have known that this place wasn't going to be very good the second I walked in. The place smelled a little off, the miso soup tasted like dishwater, the yellowtail was old and fishy, and the beef yakisoba was way overcooked.

My favorite wings by far. I order the garlic Parmesan and xxxxxx hot wings. Both boneless. My favorite! They even text you when your order is on their way! How considerate,1
"Harper's was one of the first restaurants I dined at in Charlotte.  I was impressed by the somewhat formal looking atmosphere of the interior of the restaurant (brick walls and dark wood), but pleasantly surprised by the casualness of the restaurant  Nobody's snooty there.  You can go to Harper's with a date or friends or family and get a great upscale meal at a reasonable price.  Sandwiches average about $8, salads about $10, wood-fired pizzas about $12, and full-on entrees about $15.  \n\nWith their American menu, it's also the perfect place to take out-of-town guests who want to go out \""""someplace nice\"""" but are also picky eaters.  There's nothing outlandish on the menu.  They can always find their comfort food and I, enjoying a little gourmet action, can find something like a jazzed up macaroni and cheese dish.  Their burgers are also delicious, especially with pimento cheese.  Mmmm...",1
Thank goodness for this restaurant. Above average mexican food and spectacular salsa,1
"Dollar rental car nearly ruined my family vacation! We traveled across the country to visit family. We set aside $300 for spending money. Nowhere did it say they would hold funds on our card! We got into town got the rental car, and went out to eat after a long plane ride. When we went to pay, our card was declined! This happened around midnight. We sat at the Waffle House trying to figure out why we had no money, and no way to pay our bill. We called the after hours number for the bank, and they could only tell us that there was a hold on our account. So we called Dollar rental car, where we found out they put a $250 hold on our card!!!!! That was all of our money!!! We had two small children and we were 3000 miles away from home. We said we would return the car, and rent from another company. They said we could do that, but the money would be held indefinitely. So if we returned the car, we still would have no money, and then no car on top of that!!! Please be aware that if you rent from Dollar rental, using a debit card, they will hold your money without your consent or knowledge. They will not tell you! You have to find out the hard way. If it weren't for family loaning us money, we would have been screwed! Buyer be ware! Do not rent from Dollar rent a car!!!\n\nWhat bothers me is that they didn't tell us. We were never made aware that this would happen, not when we booked it, not when we picked it up. We scoured everything we signed, and the reservation email, nowhere did it say funds would be held. They need to make you aware when they plan to hold your money hostage!!! The rental was $65. They held the money after we paid the rental in full.\n\nI read the contract and the e-mail, no where did it say this. Now after reading other reviews on yelp, I am expecting them to tack some bogus charge on later. I am so mad at this company!\nThey didn't even inspect the car for damage before we took it. While loading up suitcases, I noticed scratches and told them about it. The yelp reviews say people have been charged for damage that was already there.\n\nAlso, they said we had to fill up in Charlotte, and give them the receipt when we return it. We tried to give the gas receipt to the person when we dropped it off, but they refused to take it. Now I read on yelp that someone filled up in the city they said to, the person refused to take the receipt, and the company charge their card $30 for not providing the receipt!!! All I have to say is, that better not freaking happen! I will lose my mind!",0
"If you're looking to make a sports bet or just watch a game this place is super cool and definitely worth a visit if you're in Vegas. If you're not looking to watch a game or make a sports bet why are you even considering Lagasse's?  This place is made for sports. There's no reason why after visiting your complaint should be that it's \""""too sporty\"""" like some of the other reviews have stated.\n\nWe went this past weekend to put some bets on a basketball game.  When we got to the door a couple of the guys had cigars and were told that there was no smoking allowed inside.  (No smoking in Vegas?!?!  Weird and awesome if you're trying to get away from the cancer cloud that covers this city.) The guy told us that instead we could sit on the patio and offered to escort us there.  He then walked us around and sat us in our own little patio spot with white leather chairs and couches, two flat panel televisions, a pool table and our own private window to the bartender.  It was fantastic! At least there I could lose some major money on a basketball game with class!\n\nI was also able to experience the inside a bit during trips to the restroom and the inside was totally impressive as well.  They had more tv's than I've ever seen in a place with a very cool and chic feel.  Whether you decide to sit outside or inside you're in for a treat for watching the games.\n\nAs for the food, everything I tried was good.  We had chicken wings, soft pretzels (delicious) with cheese dipping sauce and a steak sandwich with french fries. Although it was all very tasty the surprising winner for me was the fries.  They were steak fries with truffle oil and parmesan cheese.  I don't think I've ever had a more flavorful french fry. You want to eat these. I promise.\n\nIf you're in Vegas and you're looking to watch the game at a stylish place with major television real estate and solid food options this is the place for you.",1
"Good stuff!. We came here Friday night during my sister's bachelorette weekend.  Our server was extremely fun and attentive and we were able to get in and out fairly quickly to get to a show. We all ordered the steak and fries and enjoyed it. The drinks were expensive though, we each got one and decided to wait until after dinner to get more drinks elsewhere. Inside was buzzing with big groups, so looks like a good spot to bring a big party. It was loud and had good energy. Overall would recommend, make reservations, it was busy.",1
"A great place to go to get out of the house, Panera offers free wi-fi and free refills on drinks and coffee!\n\nSandwiches, soups and salads are their specialties, as well as a large offering of baked goods.

I went with the tomato and mozzarella sandwich which was fresh mozzarella and roasted and fresh tomatoes and basil on a ciabatta loaf, and the broccoli cheddar soup, which was very cheesy with big pieces of broccoli. Absolutely delicious.\n\nThe soups rotate on a daily basis, so it's never the same thing.\n\nAt lunch time, it gets a little busy and I've seen the place with every table filled. They also have a few outside tables that are in range of the wi-fi.",1
"I need to preface my review with--- As I started looking for a locksmith, a bunch of shady individuals with mal-intentions came to mind, and to be quite honest, I figured these weren't real customers writing reviews. That being said, I assure you I am a very satisfied customer with absolutely no personal relation to Levi and AZ Keys Locksmith. \n\nI've had to deal with locksmiths before, and what usually happens, is that they will low-ball quote you, take your driving column apart, and give you a ridiculous quote, then threaten to leave after its in pieces if you don't want to pay the latter price. \n\nAfter getting several quotes from most locksmiths around the area, I decided to fire on Arizona Keys Locksmith, and I am very happy I did. Although I had sufficient time to make an appointment, Levi was prompt and efficient. He gave me a very reasonable quote, and after all was said and done, he didn't even charge me to cut the lock on my Club(its a Jeep, don't judge me). \n\nLevi gives the community that can be questionable a very credible and reputable name. I'm so confident in Levi's knowledge base and integrity, that I can say for as long as AZ Keys Locksmith is in business, I will never call another Locksmith.",1
"DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! I understand they are renovating the place, and maybe when that is over it will be a different story, but I have never, EVER, wanted to run out of an establishment so badly.\n\nBooked a room for 4 nights, took one look at the room, and ran downstairs to demand a refund.\n\nThe carpets are filthy and stinky, wall paper was peeling off the bathroom walls, our non smoking room STUNK of marijuana and cigarettes, the balcony door was permanently locked.\n\nAsked someone at the front desk if there was a nicer room and was informed that there wouldn't be until October 8th. \n\nI spoke with the manager and told her that it is CRUEL to rent rooms out without warning customers. The idea that anyone would PAY to stay here is beyond me. It was SO disgusting I'm not even sure I will visit the place when it's \""""renovated\"""" - they need to just tear the place down.",0
"I love shopping at HT! Stores are clean and the employees always helpful and friendly. We recently moved and don't have a HT anywhere near us but 4 stores equal distance from us. I started shopping at this location due to location but this past Friday was the last time. My husband and I were shopping at this location two weeks ago, where we came across boxes of frozen items on the last row, no one around, and ice cream melted. We went and found someone to let them know and they started putting away the items?? Really! On Friday, I went to the bathroom and as I was washing my hands, an employee walks out of a stall and straight out the door!  And finally I went to the deli to get lunch meat. I am not sure if the gentleman helping me was new as I had never seen him before. I asked a question about the special and he replied with \"""" I will do this once because I don't want to argue with you!\"""" Really asking a question is considered arguing? That was their 3rd strike! I will not still shop at HT but I will pick another location. I am not sure if they kept the employees from the lowe's food. If so this could be why the employees are not up to my HT shopping par.",0
"Have been a big fan of Spinato's since I was first introduced a few years back. I have been to the North Phx, Tempe, and Scottsdale locations and they're all very pleasant.\n\nI would highly recommend their spaghetti calzone to a first-time diner.  I like it with or without the meatballs and ricotta cheese options.  You may be able to split the \""""small\"""" size between two people.  \n\nDecent pricing for a date for two:  \n- They have nightly drink specials (1/2 off bottles of wine, ladie's night, guy's night, etc.)\n- Split the Small House salad & fresh bread to start (or indulge in the mozzarella cheesy garlic bread)\n- Get the Spaghetti Calzone (my favorite item on the menu)\n- Maybe add on a personal size pizza too - the flavor is great!  I go with the thin crust and about any combination of toppings will do the trick.\n\nAlso - take home any leftovers - they re-heat great for a couple days!",1
"The owner did in fact replace my screen for the second time,, AFTER my husband had to call and speak to owner since he continued to talk to me like I could be convinced what he had to say goes. NOT my style. The phone has continued to glitch.... testing multiple times in store cannot guarantee it to replicate the problem. You can't actually believe that people are idiots. And as for a last thought... my phone is shattered again, from a VERY short fall. I dropped my phone with the ORIGINAL APPLE screen multiple times and such a soft fall didn't affect it. Whatever brand was used to replace is not a very good quality brand.",0
"It's actually pretty good for how inexpensive the prices were. Although they do not have a large menu, they had a good range of selections. Walking along the strip or even driving by it, you could easily miss it. It's in a marketplace of restaurants and vendors close to Polo Towers and the Travelodge.\n\nAfter eating finely the two days prior on the Las Vegas Strip, we decided as a group to stroll the marketplace (which was steps away from our hotel --the Polo Towers) and see what we wanted to eat that wouldn't cost a lot, and couldn't drive anyway because none of us could legally do that at the time, if you catch my drift.\n\nThere weren't too many patrons inside so service wasn't slow for us. There's a good number of tables and seats here as well as a wall mural of photos depicting food around the world. The 6 of us sat down, ordered food, and received food in a timely fashion. We were out of there in 15mins and didn't feel rushed...except that it was almost time for the Walking Dead episode to come on..\n\nI ordered the miso ramen. I've had better noodles in San Diego but the broth was nice. No MSG present (I'm sensitive to MSG so I'll know), and really satisfies me. Others in my group got a roasted duck and BBQ pork bowl (roasted duck has bones so beware), roasted duck and wontons soup,  as well as shrimp fried rice which had full shrimps tossed in.\n\nNot bad compared to other eateries on the strip and doesn't hurt my wallet.",1
"Cute little crepe diner; Love that it is locally owned, clean, friendly, yummy and thriving! Best location near Anthem locale. It's nice they have gluten free and vegetarian crepes to accommodate. I always get The Little Italy crepe, yummy every visit. The dessert crepes are awesome.

"I just moved to the area and needed several big ticket items. When i first came in I was pleased with the service I received in appliances. About a week later i placed my order over the phone to take advantage of their black friday pricing. When i mentioned to the person taking my order that I would like to pay with a lowes account to take advantage of the 5% off and financing i was told i would have to be in the store physically to do so ,otherwise that person i worked with would not get credit for the order. OK,i liked her style and service and passed on the deal as i planned originally to pay cash anyways. (nice guy ,huh) I thought so...then i mentioned i had a 10% off coupon and was told it was not valid with this order..ok ( i believe you..lol..mistake).Note: i subsequently spoke to a manger about the 10% off,he honored it because it was valid..nice huh? dont you just love employees who will go to any length to get the deal done for themselves? amazing! Anyways fast forward a few days I followed up to make sure everything was on schedule..surprise they had it scheduled to be delivered 3 days before I was arriving..after i specifically told this person over and over the date I wanted (veneer starting to crack on salesperson of the year). Day of delivery,no call from delivery service as promised to set up delivery for that day. Surprise we forgot we will be there later today Mr B.......OK Delivery arrives...MrB we have a damage on the side of your fridge ..but if you accept it we will give you a 15% discount on the ENTIRE delivery....lol OK sure Ill take it...now mind you i asked 5 times and had them put it on the delivery invoice. If they didnt take the 15% of all I wouldent accept any. this was crystal clear. So following up as a professional does ...I found that my credit hadent shown up yet and spoke to a lowes manager on duty. went something like this mike:checking on my credit for the 15% lowes:sorry your not getting the 15% on the order only the fridge mike: thats not what i was told lowes:are you crazy ,why would we give you 15% on the whole order only the fridge was damaged? mike: that makes sense to me but your delivery service offered this deal to me,so i expect you to honor it lowes:no chance mike: i plan to make many big ticket items for my new home if you dont honor your promiise I will never do business with your company again lowes: have a nice life mike: very nice. \n\nOh he also tried to say that lowes contracts for the delivery's which they do and if i had a problem i should take it up with them.\n\nLISTEN VERY CLOSELY:\n\n1. I dont like being lied to by your employee to close a deal to start\n\n2. Your follow up and order system are horrible.\n\n3.I bought these products from YOU not XYZ delivery service..YOU need to call them up to resolve it. If i have someone working for me I am very clear on what they can and cannot offer to satisfy a delivery. Its not up to me to make it right nor am i responsible to fix or train your delivery contractor on the art of negotiation. He told me what I was getting and as a representative you are obligated to take care of me.Wherever you extract that money from to cover that mistake is not my business or concern.\n\nThis transaction illustrates the clunky nature of corporate transactions and the mentality that is accepted by compartmentalizing the responsibility for all actions along the entire life span of the order. By doing this they can blame each other and wash their hands of the problem. Very clever...you just lost a customer and all of the friends who he knows. But ,I know all you guys do is average it out over many transactions. I doubt Ill be missed for a nano second.\n\nHome Depot here I come !",0

"Good place to sit down, have a few nice drinks, and relax. I wouldn't recommend this place for dinner, as most of the stuff they have here are good, but of small, bite-size portions to pair with drinks. We usually go here before dinner to grab some drinks and appetizers and hang out before dinner.\n\nThe service has always been pretty good so far. \n\nI can't speak for their wine selection, but they do have a pretty decent whisk(e)y selection. As far as scotch goes, they break down the whiskys by regions, e.g., Islay, Speyside, Highland, etc..., which is nice. They also have a good rye and irish selection, if that's your thing. They also have a pretty good happy hour, and a whisky of the month that they'll offer at half the price. \n\nOne of the things I really enjoy about this place is their outdoor sitting area where they also offer cigars for you to enjoy with your drink.

"Location: On Queen Mary, east of D\u00e9carie Boulevard. The closest subway stops are C\u00f4te-des-Neiges (Orange) and Snowdown (Blue).\n\nThe Place: Even if you're not religious, this is still worth a visit. Situated at the top of Mount Royal, you can see the dome from a distance on a sunny day - but when you're actually AT the Oratory, the view of the city from the lookout is spectacular. Architecturally, this is a beautiful place. The church itself is nothing special to look at compared to Notre-Dame or some of the churches I saw in Italy, but the energetic pull of the place is something else. You will see many a devout person attending mass here, lighting candles for a loved one or, more importantly, making their pilgrimage to the oratory, from the bottom of the parking lot, up the stairs, on their knees. No, I'm not kidding. St. Joseph's Oratory was home to the now famous Fr\u00e8re Andr\u00e9, who was known to heal the crippled, the paralyzed - you name it. You will find walls filled with crutches inside the church, as a testament to all those he healed. You can also visit his teeny tiny home, and see the sacred room where his heart is kept. No, I'm not kidding. \n\nAdditional info: They have a large gift shop for those who want to buy rosaries and other religious goods, including holy water.\n\nPrice point: I personally don't remember ever having to pay to access the oratory.",1

"In a nondescript and slightly run down shopping plaza is this lovely French-themed gem of a bakery- sandwiches, soups, and more breads, pastries, and desserts than you can shake a stick at!\n\nI'm on a somewhat-healthy kick, so on today's visit I steered clear of the baked goods.. I mean, aside from the baguette my sandwich was served on. What kind of heathen do you take me for?!\n\nOrdered the full size pastrami sandwich and a cappuccino, shared with the BF.\nOrder came out quickly and was better than expected- pastrami is not a thick, heaping portion, but a thinner, sparser portion that is packed with flavor. The baguette is soft and crispy in the appropriate places, and the condiments were house-made: I'm not a mayonnaise fan, but I'd bathe myself in this stuff. It was fresh and delicious, and the condiments really did make a difference.\nThe sandwich was served alongside a small salad of mixed greens, red onion, tomato, and a house dressing- again, a delicious condiment. Whoever is in charge of concocting the sauces is a star! I inhaled the salad and left a scant bite or two for my guy. He was distracted by the sandwich.\n\nAlready I can say we'll be back- in fact, Sprout's double ad day (every Wednesday) may now also be our standing Bakery Date Night until we try all of the sandwiches. Next time we'll have the salami and ham with cheese, and we'll have to come in sooner to get a cup of soup- they were sold out by our late afternoon visit.\n\nOh, and the cappuccino was perfect.

There is one flat screen and it is always playing sports (great for sports fans) not so much for family and kids.

I had this PostNet location pack and ship a very fragile large heirloom. They did a bad job and it arrived at destination totally broken.

By that point when I tried to file claim direct with Fed Ex them said that it was too late to file claim. Now I'm out $500! I'd never recommend them to anyone for shipping.,0

"I decided to take my wife here for our anniversary.  I have never tried it before and with the decent reviews and the ad stating it had the best view in Las Vegas, I thought what the heck.  I called and made reservations and told them It was our anniversary and asked for a table with a nice view.  We arrived up the elevator with another couple.  They asked if we had reservation and I said yes, the other couple said no.  We were taken to a table only one spot away from the desk and right across from the kitchen.  The couple without the reservations were taken down the way a bit and placed in a booth.  I guess when I asked for a nice view the kitchen help was what they considered nice.  They had a view of northwest Vegas, we had a view of building tops and other hotels.  We saw the waiter three times the entire time we were there.  Once to take our drink order, once to take our food order and to give us the bill.  If not for the bus boy we would have felt alone.  I wanted to order a beer with dinner but I never had that opportunity.  The food was better than average but not worth the price.  Outback, half the price and almost as good, with better service.  Outback is louder but not busier since we were next to the kitchen, but the server comes and checks in on you now and again at Outback.  Would I go back there?  Absolutely not!  Would I recommend it?  Absolutely not!  There are too many high quality steak houses in Las Vegas to take a chance of ending up with a sour taste in my mouth for the entire dinner again.",0
"I so wanted to be impressed by Rice & Co.  Not only is it a favorite of some dear friends but it was on Food Network!\n\nUnfortunately, the food was mediocre at best and the service was atrocious.  \n\nOur server said they were known for their sushi.  Both the Mad Dragon and the Philly roll we had were flavorless and boring.\n\nShe also raved about their Peking Duck.  Granted I compare all Peking Duck to the duck at Peking Gourmet and that is a high bar.  But this was overcooked, greasy, and the serving was downright silly.  They folded the pancakes up to make it pretty but that ended up tearing each pancake, making them impossible to roll.  They only gave 6 pancakes for a whole duck then charged $5 for additional pancakes!\n\nWe also had the Orange Peel chicken, nice flavor but barely any chicken on the plate.  The Shrimp Tempura appetizer only had three shrimp on it.  Granted it had two onion rings, two asparagus, and two sweet potato pieces, but they should call it a tempura platter or a mixed tempura platter because the shrimp were definitely outnumbered and not the star of the dish.\n\nI'm giving them 2 stars instead of one because of the cleanliness of the restaurant and the tastiness of the mango gelato.\n\nWe paid $180 for the above with no alcoholic beverages, in fact three of us just had water.  \n\nSo as another had posted, if you want to spend your money on overpriced, tasteless food with non-existent service then DEFINITELY come here.  Otherwise don't bother.",0
"my husband and i went here about a week ago. i ordered whatever special they had that day and he ordered a steak burrito. the chicken (something) special was passable... it was essentially a small piece of chicken inside a wrap and fried... bland and plain but OK. the beans i didnt touch since they didnt look fresh or good. and the rice just looked and tasted bad....\nmy husbands was much worse than mine, his looked like it was precooked i dont think i need to explain how a precooked steak burrito tastes lol.\n\ngross.\n\nthe only thing i actually appreciated about the place is that the owner was there and did offer to refill our drinks.... overall though would not go back based on the food.",0

Actually had our barbecue cleaned by Joe Filter!\nThe tech was friendly and our old barbecue looks like NEW!,1
"My wife and I joined friends at Ohjah Japanese Steakhouse (Blue Diamond and Decatur) recently. I was a little hesitant about the restaurant choice because I've never had a taste for sushi, but the majority rules, so I agreed. It was the night before New Year's Eve, and the restaurant was pretty much filled. Chefs were putting on shows at many tables. Patrons were clearly enjoying themselves; the restaurant was buzzing with laughter and excited chatter. Our service started off a little slow, but soon we had our appetizers. Everyone in our group had sushi; mine, thankfully, was cooked. And it was very good! Between the delicious appetizers and the salad, I was enjoying myself in spite of my earlier reservations about going to a restaurant known for its sushi. I could have left at the point and been very satisfied. \n\nBut then the chef - I believe his name is Van - came over to our end of the table and started an amazing display of acrobatic and culinary showmanship that was a joy to watch. He introduced each element to us and was soon flipping things into the air and even flipped a cup into his hat all the while keeping a fast beat with his cooking tools. Fascinating to watch! The scallops and shrimp were excellent, and the vegetables were cooked and seasoned to perfection. But the standout was the steak. The most tender and flavorful steak I've had in years. Melt-in-your-mouth with no fat or waste at all. And we had more than enough to take home for leftovers. \n\nWe left late, and as the chef and then the waiter cleaned the table, we asked what they were cleaning with. Lemon juice, they said - no chemicals. That impressed us. And he said they would clean it again the next morning. Overall, we were very impressed. Delicious food, very clean restaurant (even the restrooms were immaculate), friendly service and a terrific show, too. The Ohjah at Blue Diamond and Decatur is definitely worth revisiting.",1
"If ur looking for a fast intimate wedding chapel of the flowers is the place .. I can't  thank everyone enough for such an amazing and beautiful wedding the process was fast yes they ask for gratitude for every service but I'd rather pay what we did for our ceremony n pictures to have the most important people those (immediate family) some friends and not have any one criticize how every detail of my wedding was ( unnecessary guest)  by far amazing and truly satisfied me and my husband married January 18, 2014 and it was the best day of my life! Thank you chapel of the flowers!!",1
Sapporo is mediocre. The food isn't very good. The last time I went there I got my appetizer before I got my drink. The service was terrible. They do have a really cheap happy hour. I would rather go to Blue Wasabi for sushi and drinks any day.,0
"I've ordered from China roll quite a few times, the foods quality changes depending on the date, the delivery times are very slow, they forgot the cashew chicken on my most recent order (that took over an hour to arrive) called the store they said they would make some fresh and send it out... it never arrived they are now closed for the night..\nHonest opinion stay away and find something else",0
"Love that this is here. Hard to find healthy choices in Las Vegas. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES!\nNice assortment of juices and smoothies.\nFriendly people, great service.\nHard to find,in Partell pharmacy near the Carl's Jr.",1
"Not even for the price was it good food. It wasn't particularly bad it was just meh for the price I have had much better. Don't waste your time here, there are plenty of better places to the north and south that are better and, honestly, worth the money. Save your nickels and dimes and cook at home then go to a real restaurant with the savings.",0
"The worst hotel experience ever. First, I have to commend the hotel staff, because they were friendly, professional, and helpful. BUT...they can't make up for all the problems this hotel has. My first night there, I was happy with my room in the pyramid. I've stayed here before, so it was as I remembered it. Other than not enough blankets on the bed and no bathtub just a shower, it was a fine room for the money. It was clean and nicely decorated.  Except for the fact that at one-thirty in the morning, I started hearing water dripping in the bathroom, then splashing. It gets louder and louder, until I get up and go  look, and water is pouring through the light fixture in the ceiling. All over the vanity and onto the floor. Pouring. I call the front desk and they have someone there in five minutes. I have to pack up all of my stuff,  and they move me to another room. They tell me I'm lucky, because the room is an upgrade, with a large soaking tub. But the room is not an upgrade, it's a dump. It feels as if they put me in some out of the way, rarely used closet. There is an old fridge in the corner, that has been rolled in on wheels, with bath towels folded up under it to keep it from leaking on the floor. The light over the tub doesn't work, so you have to sit in the dark, since it's in a corner. There are stains on the toilet seat, and stains on the carpet. I was excited for the tub, until I realized the cold water won't turn on. I'm sick of moving, so I try to handle it myself, by pouring ice cubes in the tub. AND then when I walk into the weirdly shaped little dining area, my feet get wet, and I notice the ROOF IS LEAKING from the rain we are having. The carpet is soaked. I really, really, don't want to ask for another room, because I don't want to pack up and move again. But I figure I better at least tell someone. I call the manger- who has left me a voicemail asking how I like the new room- and let her know about the roof leak. Since I don't want to move she offers to comp a night. I ask if she'll comp room service instead, and she does, happily. SO, all in all, I feel terrible for the staff that is trying to do damage control for a building that is not being cared for in any way shape or form. I got the impression they are trying to squeeze every last cent out of the hotel and are just biding their time until it's time to demo it for something new. Also, along the walkways back to the elevator, I noticed what looked like black mold along the corners of the ceilings. Roof is prolly leaking everywhere. Also, the elevators are visibly falling apart in places from the stress of the sideways- it's an inclinator really, not actually an elevator. MGM owns this place, and they should be ashamed of themselves.",0
I love their food and was a usual for a while. They always gave me a discount when I presented my coupon and told me to save it again for next time. This stopped happening and service got rude. Not sure what made the same staff have such a bad attitude change.,0
"We have been stopping at this restaurant for many years on our way north out of the valley and have enjoyed the food and service but, in the last couple of years we have been very disappointing in the service and the food.\n\nThe past three times we have been in the waitresses didn't smile, they were curt, the food was just mediocre and we had to ask to get refills on drinks. \n\nLast week when we were there I went into the restroom and a waitress came in behind me, she used the restroom and did not wash her hands before walking out the door, and was serving food when I came out.\n\nI understand that the theme of the restaurant is rustic but, the tables have food caked in the crevices of the table every time we visit and that is simply unhealthy.",0
"Whoever the manager was on Sunday 30th Dec was awful. I called to let him know that we got a pizza with things on it we did not order. His response was, \""""we use a mix so if you order green peppers you get other peppers, and i'll bet you $1000.00 there was no tomato on your pizza, you're just saying that because you didn't like my pizza\"""".\nNot acceptable. I will never go there again. We have given them many chances and I'm always disappointed. If I have the opportunity to talk to the owner I will let him know his people need to step it up...My only frustration is that we actually have tipped ungrateful people :(",0
"Sadly Switch you have disappointed me. While I have heard friends rave about the food and drinks, my experience was quite the opposite. Mainly I was just unimpressed by the food and drinks. My drink tasted like cherry cough syrup and my food was just mediocre. Maybe I will try it again sometime and hopefully have a better experience.",0
"Well, I'll have to begin by explaining (in answer to Gene's question about the sushi/pizza combo) that this is a kosher place. No, that does not mean that a rabbi has blessed you pizza. It does mean that the cheese on the pizza is vegetarian (i.e. no rennet);\n\nthis is a vegetarian joint\n\nand it has a zany and off-the-wall menu which now includes a Mexican night (Wednesday?).\n\nI am a pizza snob to the core. King Solomon's has been hit or miss in the past as it has changed ownership a couple of times. I wanted to revisit today before writing a review. I ordered the lunch special- two slices and a drink for $5.99. The slices are AZ size as opposed to NY size. This is just fine by me- two slices fill me up nicely. The sauce is generous and flavorful. There was just a little too much cheese for me, which means it's light on the cheese for your average Zonie. The crust is thin and crisp.\n\nI have heard mixed reviews concerning the Israeli platter. I have not heard anything about sushi or Mexican here.\n\nWarning: KS is closed on shabbos: sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. Saturday night it opens and is subsequently flooded with families.\n\nGreat place. Go.",1
Too bad. Never come back for $50 and nothing to eat at all. Meat is not good and not many different kinds to choose,0
"Seriously good stuff here.  Yes, the lines are long but that's not really their fault.  The food is great and people want to come here.\n\nThe waffle here is simply the best.  I've never had better, anywhere.  I've also had the burger, which was really, really, really good.  Next time I'll see if they can put a different cheese on it because I'm not a big fan of American cheese.  Regardless, everything here was delicious, regardless of the line.  If you're willing to wait, or maybe come at an off-hour, it's definitely worth the wait.",1
"I used Diamond this past Saturday for a few miscellaneous repairs around my home. Besides being a half hour late, Diamond's services were perfect. The quality of the repairs were high, and the prices were fair. I would recommend Diamond to my friends and family.",1
"Amazing! \n\nI have been talking about getting a bikini wax for years but never did because I was too afraid that the pain would be so bad I would want to die. I had mentioned it to a co-worker and she said that I should try Bliss for my first time; she had mentioned that it was the least painful waxing she had ever had. Super nervous and only 5 days from my beachy honeymoon I decided that it was now or never; I booked my appointment, and one more for a friend (if I was going to be in pain, someone else would be too). \n\nIt was the week of my wedding and was out running last minute errands the morning of my appointment, I had lost track of time and realized that I was now running late. I was very worried that I was going to lose my appointment and pay for it, you leave a credit/debit card when you book your appointment in case you don't show or cancel after the approved time frame, but was very relieved when the woman on the phone said she would just push it back 30 minutes. \n\nWe showed up at the spa, which is very easy to find, and was immediately greeted by a very friendly woman behind the front desk. She informed us that it would be just a moment before we would be taken back. 1 minute later we were escorted back to the waiting area by an even friendlier woman who asked about our service and tried to reassure us that it was the least painful waxes she has ever had. We waited anxiously before Keri called me to the room of doom where I was positive that I was going to have my skin peeled off all in the name of vanity. We stepped into the room where she informed me that I would be removing the clothing on my lower half and replacing it with a pair of sanitary underwear. Keri talked me through the whole process before starting and tried to ease my anxiety by telling me that it, again, was the least painful wax. She asked me which of the three services I had decided to get, you get your choice of how much you'd like them to take off, and I let her know that I would be getting the \""""inbetweeny\"""". She reassured me that I had made a great choice for my first ever waxing experience and wouldn't be disappointed or want to die. \n\nThe whole experience from removing of clothes to putting them back on lasted all of 30 minutes and.....drum roll please....was actually tolerable! The pain, I would rate a 5-7 out of 10, really wasn't that bad! Keri made it very comfortable and, dare I say it, almost pain free! The worst part of it all was the waiting and anxiety. \n\nI would, hands down, recommend this spa to anyone and everyone. The experience from start to finish was great.",1
"Interesting place. Expansive menu. They apparently take pride in the ingredients in their food, which is a good thing.\n\nJust don't tell them that you're under any sort of time constraint, as they really don't seem to care, despite the fact that it was mentioned *several* times. I wouldn't recommend it for lunch during the week on your lunch hour, even if \""""lunch\"""" happens to be 2:00 PM. On a Tuesday. \n\nI'm guessing that the slow service is because they take the time to let your food die from natural causes, painlessly, in its sleep, before cooking it up and serving it to you. \n\nHonestly, I'm kind of disappointed, especially after the rave reviews that friends had given it.\n\nWhen I checked in, the Yelp app asked me if Hillside Spot was \""""hipster\""""; I guess that sums it up. They're not worried about \""""the man's\"""" bourgeois constructs like \""""time\"""" and \""""work\"""".\n\nIn short- food... Good. Service... Good. Attention to time constraints... Needs work.",0
"Had to get an Ultrasound and I work on this side of town. So I took a couple hours off to get it done, then head back to work.\nThey were organized and friendly. My radiologist was very nice and seemed to do her job well. The facility was very clean, in a nice area. I would recommend this location and go back to this location if the need arises.",1
"Food-frickin-gasm! \n\nWas on a business trip, had one night in Phoenix, one meal, wanted it to be memorable. Researched heavily on Yelp and Triple D and came down to this one little Italian restaurant.\n\nWork friend and I agreed we had to try the two dishes highlighted on DDD; 5 meat bolognese with homemade pasta and Osso Bucco. First started with a salad with fresh mozzarella, pesto, tomatoes, basil. Wow it was so fresh, so amazing. The waiter suggested we get the bolognese sauce with a special homeade pasta that was filled with ricotta but yet light and airy and smaller than a penne but not hollow. Very unique softness to it and it was just incredible with this meat sauce. \n\nSecond I have to say I would not typically order osso bucco but since it was highlighted on the show as a melt in your mouth good, I couldn't resist. This night it was made with veal shank. This was three huge veal shanks that filled the entire plate with a homeade lingini pasta with ruffled edges like lasagna noodles and this wonderful dark rich tomato/wine flavor sauce that was just amazing by itself. Wow you literally did not have to chew this meat and I am not exaggerating! \n\nWe were just awestruck over the flavors of these dishes, the cozy environment and the amazing friendliness of the restaurant. The owner came over several times to ask us how we liked it and we both were so impressed with the customer service overall.\n\nTo top it off, our amazing waiter was nice enough to save us the last caramel gelato with praline pecans crunched up small, OMG so smooth, sweet and perfect! I cannot wait to bring my other work associates here when I come back to Phoenix in a couple of weeks!",1
"Went here before a hockey game, and got wings and a local beer, I think it was the Kiltlifter.  The prices were reasonable, the wings were just spicy enough, and the beer was good.  The beer was recommended by a bartender when I told him that I usually drink Stone or Sam Adams.  Can't complain.",1
"I've only eaten here for lunch. I would highly recommend it! It's fast, friendly, priced right & very good. I always order the Pad Thai w/ chicken. They offer a spice (heat) range from 1 to 5 (5 being the hottest). I usually go with a 4. At lunch, for $7.95, you get unsweetened tea, soup, & your entree dish. They offer a different soup every day of the week. There is something to be said about friendly service and this place has it! To walk in and be greeted by name is a nice feeling. Because of my job, I once went almost a year without going in, but my first time back, I was greeted by name with a friendly smile, seated, and they even remembered what I used to order. Wow! It can sometimes be pretty busy at lunch time but the wait is never too long. You've got to give it a try!",1
there other location closed!!!! this is my spot please eat here!!!! they are awesome the service is great and now i have to drive to the east side to eat.....i dont know what i would do if this location closed they have employees that have been working for them for 25 years i think that says something about the owners ummm like they are awesome... i ate today at this location to find out my dear marta and mirta are still there but manuel is not... the food was still great the service too i love chapalas,1
"My husband and I stayed last night and we agreed that we will not be staying here again. It wasn't a horrible stay, but it was very overpriced.  The bed was pretty comfortable but it was super short -- not sure how a tall person would be able to sleep without their feet hanging over the edge.  The decor was nice, especially in the hotel lounge area and nightclub/restaurants, but the furnishings inside the room were not that great: some of the lamps and light switch plates were crooked on the wall and the amenities (soaps, etc) were subpar.  The shower was very weak. When we checked in, we were given someone else's rewards card by mistake: oops. The worst parts:\n1. The constant, continuous, very LOUD, AWFUL pop? music.....inside and outside -- there are speakers in the parking lots so as you can hate it as you leave (we left at 4am - yep, that's nice for the customers...)  My hearing was definitely damaged. \n\n2.  The casino is SMOKE-Y!! My clothes were immediately saturated and I fought a headache the entire time.  There are signs marking the non-smoking slot machines, but the signs were generally ignored. People lit up everywhere. Ugh.\n\n3. Service was mixed. Most people were nice and helpful, but we didn't appreciate that there was no posted information stating what the hours/prices for the unlimited buffet were and everyone had to stand in line for 30 minutes only to be unpleasantly surprised by the menu prices (sign in casino -- $14.99 -- reality on Sat. at 4pm: $25+/person.) Why do the cashiers have to deal with all this negative energy upon ringing people up?  An easy solution: get a sign that shows hours and prices!!  The buffet was okay, not great.  Not one person I saw in the casino had a drink and we were only offered a drink once.  We were approached many, many times, however, about getting a rewards card. Bleah. No thanks.\n\n4. The pool area was confusing -- lots of little shallow pools? Uh....ok..looks like a setup for some weird parties, not swimming. \n\nMeh says it all.",0
"Cheskie's is a Jewish bakery, not a typical Montreal patisserie/bakery. I must admit that I don't have much of a point of reference as I don't typically frequent Jewish bakeries. Furthermore I only purchase one item a Cheskie's and I don't even know what it's real name is. I call it the 'Chocolate Bomb'. They sit in a big tray on the back counter and I think that there is a second flavour, caramel or cinnamon or some such thing. I did try that once and it is not as good as the chocolate. \n\nYes there are many other items at Checkie's that look very tasty and each time I head over there I think to my self 'I'll give something new a try today'. Then I see my 'Chocolate Bomb' and I can't take my eyes off of it. I start thinking about how wonderfully packed full of chocolate it is and how the dough is so sweet and moist and how every bite will just melt in your mouth. Before I know it, I've ordered the 'Chocolate Bomb' and again not given something else a try.",1
"reservations at 830pm. \ngreeted promptly and was seated. \nwater down in about 2 min after it was ordered. \nwine came about 5 min later than my liking... perhaps it needed to be breathing much longer. \nbread: i needed more flavor. and the butter was a sad excuse so bland! c'mon tom!\n\nstarters: decided to go with some classics to see how the great tom would fair. 1) lobster bisque- okay. good chunks but not exciting. \n2) Cesar salad-okay but a bit off, not exactly perfect but almost...\n\nsurf and turf... 1) steak was done just right cooking temp. but was lacking anything to help the meat taste amazing. sides with 1 was lobster... it was okay. the 2) side was prawns which was good. \n\nshared some fries with ketchup that doesn't come with it. and when you ask they just have it in a bottle. the dish also for the hot plates doesn't fit so it might be wobbling when you are slicing into you food. \n\ntoo sad to even order dessert. \n\nsorry tom, you didn't live up to my expectations. perhaps another time, cuz i still adore you.",0
"I LOVE this place. Never a bad experience!\nThe food is great, I haven't had everything, as I do not like spicy foods.

"Go to this place if you would like horrible service and a huge bill. I paid $100 to get my BMW detailed and was told it would take an hour-hour and a half. TWO AND A HALF HOURS LATER I looked and saw no one working on my car for at least twenty minutes. Then had to beg them to hurry and finish because I had to leave.

"Wow, what an interesting mix of people in the crowed.\n\nIt was like walking into a bar that time forgot. OK, I don't really know what that meant.

"OH MY GOD THIS PLACE IS THE WORST.\n\nThat's the short end of it.  Here's the long end of it:\n\nI had the displeasure of visiting The Chelsea twice at the end of December for back-to-back Killers concerts.  Each night was a nightmare for different reasons.  I'll try to keep it simple.\n\n1. The first night, they decided to not keep the air on an appropriate level for a giant group of people.  To sum it up, two girls behind me passed out and a guy threw up before the band even came on.  No one wanted to move because we were so hot, and therefore, the band thought we were disinterested.  I almost left because I thought I was going to pass out as well.\n\n2.  A fight broke out right in the front by the barrier and right where a line of security guards were standing.  The security guards just stood there and watched the fight.  The band had to stop playing during the middle of a song and tell the security guards to break it up.  \n\n3.  The second day, people had arrived early to get in line.  We were not allowed to wait in front of The Chelsea which is on the fourth floor and away from the rest of the casino.  Instead, security had everyone wait on the floor below The Chelsea in a giant group, not being allowed to form any sort of line.  (If we formed our own line they told us they would break it up). At five p.m., security had us all (the giant mob of people) running up escalators, pushing past each other, trying to get a spot in line by The Chelsea.  I'm still shocked no one was trampled (we are talking a couple hundred people).  Imagine the liability if someone was seriously hurt.  This was security's brilliant idea to deal with fans??  Who hired these people???  Not only was it dangerous, but it wasn't fair to the people that had been waiting for hours to wind up behind someone who just showed up. UNBELIEVABLE. \n\n4.  Even if you manage to put up a fight in The Hunger Games and get a good spot in line, don't expect to be at the barrier in front of the stage.  The Cosmopolitan sells \""""VIP\"""" tickets for an extra charge.  Looking at Ticketmaster, it seemed as though VIP had a special section off to the side with their own bar to use.  I guess that's what I get for assuming.  Heads up - if there is a band you really want to be up front for, make sure you purchase a VIP ticket.  The VIPs all get to go in The Chelsea before General Admission and take up the whole front of the venue.  And I'm talking people who are rich and don't give a shit about the music and are just there for something to do.  Nothing like having 200 of these people in front of you after you've been in line all day.\n\n5.  A half bottle of water costs $5.  Perhaps this is why the air conditioner isn't turned on? Large profit margins much?\n\n6.  While people are jumping to the music, if you stand still, you will feel the ground shaking out of control.  I'm surprised people have not fallen through the floor of this place yet.\n\nThis is a ballroom that was hastily turned into a music venue so The Cosmo could cash in.  I would only recommend my worst enemies to go see a concert there.  Be prepared for stress on various levels if you choose to see a show here.\n\nFrom what I understand, they are building an actual music venue (also to be called The Chelsea) that should be opened up later this year.  I pray to God they make it right.  I also pray their security goes through some training in the meantime.\n\nFAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL.  Negative 3 billion stars.",0
"Pretty darn good. The bagels are really good and the coffee (they roast their own, BTW) is great!! My only criticism is they need to put more cream cheese on the bagels. Honestly..... just filling the pores of the cut bagel with cream cheese is NOT a schmear!!!!!  I really liked the cheddar bagels. You can tell the owner (a VERY nice fellow, BTW) really wants this place to fly and I hope it does. The decor is pretty decent with various artwork (that's for sale) hanging all about the walls and a separate \""""reading-room\"""" type of area that has a couch, coffee table, and easy-chair. Yeah... I'll go back!  Oh.... FREE WiFi too!!! :-)",1
"We stopped in for lunch this past weekend.  It had been a while.  Nothing has changed.  It's just good food, at a good price, executed well, and served attentively.  What else do you want when dining out in Indian Trail?!",1
"Located inside Harrah's casino this burger joint has good burgers and milkshakes, they have a capt. crunch shake thats tasty. We also tried the waffle fry nachos which i would of been impressed w if it wasnt for the bbq beef from a tub you can get at your local grocery store typically made by Lloyd;s or Hormel. But not terrible  just not a fan of the tub or can meats unless i'm in a zombie apocalypse. They also have a liquor, beer, wine selection and the wait time wasn't bad they just need a pager type system instead of calling the names of folks, its a casino people are going to wonder off to play a slot machine and wont be able to hear their named called. we used a groupon $15 for $30 which was a good deal. The wait staff as friendly and helpful.",0
"Staff did not acknowledge us in any way until we ordered, and were unable to answer basic questions about their products. \n\nWe ordered a chicken salad sandwich; it was adequate, but I've had better. It was accompanied by a small bag of off-brand kettle chips and a tiny plastic sample cup full of \""""pasta salad\"""", which was just some tough, flavorless penne noodles sprinkled with oregano. I expect a side dish accompanying a sandwich to be small, but seriously, a sample cup? Maybe it was intended to be decorative. \n\nWe also had a \""""classic\"""" smoothie, which was supposed to be made with real fruit and contain strawberries, banana and orange. It was decent, but so heavy on cheap orange juice that it overpowered the other flavors. \n\nAside from the disappointing food and lack of service, it seemed to be a nice enough space. They had some distinctive furniture and a variety of seating, including both a bar and comfy chairs around a fireplace; a private room in the back available for reservation; and a large outdoor patio featuring a sandbox for the kids. \n\nThe food seemed over-priced for the quality, but overall the pricing was competitive with other cafes in the area; while I can't recommend it for lunch, the patio might be a good place for parents to meet for coffee while their kids play in the sandbox. \n\nHonestly, I can't see any other reason to come here.",0
"For several years I was receiving chiropractic treatment for general pain in my lower back that I attributed to lifting a trailer some years ago. The chiropractor I was using is someone I've known since high school and felt I could trust. The adjustments and treatment I was getting would give me minor relief, but my back was never quite right. Then one day a coworker told me about Dr. Vu and Rainbow Chiropractic. This gentleman swore by Dr. Vu so I made an appointment. On my first visit we discussed the pain I was having and its origin. Dr. Vu did an adjustment on me that day, but also explained to me that I would do better with some aggressive stretching exercises. He showed me how to stretch the area properly and sent me on my way. His advice was to stretch and come back every 6 months or so unless I felt the need to get treatment. That day I was sold on Dr. Vu. He could have easily suggested I come in a few time a week as I had been doing with the other chiropractor and made a bunch of money from billing my insurance. Instead, Dr. Vu gave me an honest assessment of my situation and showed me how to get relief. It's rare to find this kind of honesty and integrity these days that's why I would recommend Rainbow Chiropractic to anyone experiencing back pain.",1
I'm still getting mailers from this place. Nope. I won't go. Keep your stinky coupons. Boo.,0
"My favorite sushi spot when I visit Las Vegas. Maybe even my all time favorite in general! Friendly service and good food. Don't be cheap and pay for just one roll, do the all you can eat sushi! It is definitely worth it. My favorite was their Ecstasy Roll. It's topped with \""""orgasm sauce\"""" and let me tell you... The name really speaks for itself. Another good one is the Crispy Rice! \n\nI've been here probably 3 or 4 times and was never disappointed. If you're in town or a local, check it out!",1
"If I could rate 1.5 stars, I would. You get what you pay for: beds to sleep in and a shower. I didn't stay here for the view, or ambiance, or any other negligible thing. If anything, the state of the room encouraged me to spend as little time in it as possible.\n\nThe line for check-in was INSANE: Not in a good way. It was so long it wen through the actual casino playing space, making it uncomfortable for casino guests, and hotel guests. Stay here, not play here I guess? I ended up going over to Harrah's anyways.\n\nThe rooms are small, not tiny, but small. The TV's a Tube TV: old and static-y. The lamp BARELY lights up the whole room. We'd have to turn on all 3 lights to be able to see decently, but it still wasn't light enough for a group of girls wanting to put on make-up: bathroom fighting space ensued. \n\nMaids Service was good. We asked for extra pillows and the like: it all came efficiently. At the time there wasn't a resort fee, so that was fairly nice, as we weren't paying for the poor Wifi or anything else. \n\nThe casino was poor. Not only was lady luck not hitting me up, but it wasnt hitting up anyone. On the craps table, I hit the field all day, which led to a lot of other people making some money on the field, but not me, haha. The drinks came slowly, and they were small in portion size. Didnt really wanna tip the waitress who had to come back ever 20 or so mins for ANOTHER drink order. Beer choices were standard, and not bad. \n\nOverall, poor. With Total rewards I can always stay here, Harrah's, Rio or Flamingo free. Gonna try the flamingo next, and we'll see.",0
"The Phoenix airport experience is horrendous. This is my second time this year and likely my last. Understaffed, one person checking in cars at 6:30am, aloof indifferent staff. Awful. I get stressed each time I rent there. I won't put up with it anymore.",0
"My husband and I went here for lunch today (Saturday) and had a really good experience. The place was empty but they had only been open for an hour. We got the beef negimaki and it was awesome! We eat got sushi for lunch, rolls and nigiri and everything tasted fresh and delicious. It was a little pricey for lunch ($48 with tip) but we will definitely be back again.",1
"I was staying at the Venetian and decided to check this place out since it is conveniently located in the hotel. There was a line outside when we got there but the bouncer moved us up to the front since we brought the promotional card given to us by the hotel. Inside was packed full of people  with a good ratio of men and women. They had half naked models in bath tubs in the center, which I thought was pretty interesting. The drinks were well made and strong. I didn't really like the music too much since it was a lot of hip hop but I think it really just depends on the night and the DJ. I still had a good time here. Check it out especially if you are staying at the Venetian.",1
"This was out first experience here. We just moved to vegas and this little local joint was awesome to enjoy as we unloaded the uhaul! \n\nThe cheesy sticks were soft, fresh, and a little salty which I loved. The dipping sauces were great too. \nWe ordered a small Italian sausage and onion with the Roma seasoning. Great flavor and perfect size left us ready to make this our new pizza spot. \n\nCustomer service was excellent.",1
"The biggest problem with Pitarifique is knowing what to order. If you like good, mom-and-pop greasy spoon, you'll probably like everything on the menu.\n\nThe menu can be broken down into about four different things: burgers, subs, pitas, and greek-style plates.\n\nThe burgers are all around solid, whether you get a single, a double, or either with bacon or cheese. Their subs are everything a greasy spoon sub should be: very generous but not so greasy that the bread turns to mush.\n\nThe pitas are pretty much souvlaki inspired, coming in either grilled chicken or gyros, and served with a generous portion of tzatziki sauce, and wrapped in a thick, fresh greek-style pita.\n\nAnd the plates, well, I've never had one, but I figure that if everything else is a 4/5, then they can't be all that bad, either.\n\nThe atmosphere is very greasy spoon, though, and space is very limited, so I'd recommend either getting it to do or calling for delivery.",1
"Their food is decent, but I can get much better from several different places nearby. I don't waste my time here anymore. \n\nFamily owned business and their reputation is horrible. Poorly treated and unpaid staff (claims with the Department of Labor), poor delivery time, mediocre food and an unimpressive restaurant that I chose not to spend time in.\n\nEdited in response to the owner: \n\nChristine,\nI'm not bringing drama to you. I'm writing an honest review about my experience at your business and why I will never patron there again. That's what Yelp is all about, right? \n\nIf you want to discuss livelihood and children, I'm happy to. You wrote a BAD CHECK to my son who delivered food for your business. You NEGLECTED TO PAY HIM for his work on top of that. I helped him file his complaint with the Bad Check Division and the Department of Labor. \n\nHis father approached you about the issue and you screamed profanities at him and kicked him out of your restaurant. \n\nI will never patron your business again for several reasons: you mistreated and stole from my family, your restaurant is dirty, your food is mediocre, and your lack of integrity is profound. \n\nIt's a shame that people like you are in business. Las Vegas is a small town and it will be a relief to me when I see your poorly run business CLOSED. If you can't afford to pay your employees, my guess is it won't take long.",0
"I showed up here when they were supposed to open at 7AM for breakfast but they didn't open till 7:08. I asked for a toasted breakfast sub with Black Forest Ham, American cheese, their yellow Egg concoction (about a week old usually), onions, cucumber, and peppers. \n\nI keep forgetting that subway American cheese is white, I should have just gotten their cheddar.\n\nThe toasting was poorly done and the customer service was pretty bad. Needless to say I'm not impressed, in fact -to help potential patrons: I'd like to let you all know that the juices in store cost $1.49-$3.15 but you can get more variety juices from the vending machines for $1.25.",0
"If you're considering getting waxed, read below as well, but just for nails, well, the nail job was poorly done and rushed. I could have done a more thorough job at home, and not wound up with spots of nail polish on my skin. I will NEVER EVER ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever EVER go back!  And I highly recommend that you don't even try it, either. \n\nAnd in regards to the waxing: Oh if only you could give negative stars. In this case, I definitely would. I learned a hard lesson today. NEVER EVER use the \""""express\"""" salons/spas in malls. EVER! Especially when you've got to look nice (like, say, for your birthday party). I've used them before but NEVER again. The lady giving me my pedicure asked me if I wanted my eyebrows waxed. I said no. She asked again. I said no, again. She asked a third time (very pushy), and though I had been saying no, I knew it needed to be done because I had some scraggliness off to the side. So I finally said yes. AND I GOT BURNED! Like bright red, with tiny white welts BURNED! I looked like some sort of effed up raccoon. And they all kept staring, not asking if I needed aloe. It should have been obvious to anyone with eyes that the post-wax condition of my general eyebrow area WAS NOT normal. If they'd had an easily available mirror on the inside, I wouldn't have left. Period. It was embarrassing. I went to the Carmen! Carmen! Prestige Salon in Belk and they fixed EVERYTHING and I am so thankful that they had openings and were willing to help. \n\nAfterwards I went back to the salon, just to mention that their wax was too hot and they completely denied it and put the blame on me and said I should have asked them for aloe to fix it. Aloe didn't cut it. It took hours of ice compresses, along with several skin-clearing/redness-relief creams, and a full face of makeup to hide it for my birthday party that night. Also, apparently they use \""""multi-purpose wax\""""- I don't know what this means but it seems to imply that  it's not necessarily gentle enough for the face which would make sense. AND the skin under my eyebrow was lifted. Not good. Not good at all. I have some choice words for these people but likely would have been escorted out of the mall by security had I chosen to use them.",0

"We strolled in to Senor Frogs for lunch the day after the Super  Bowl thinking we were going to have good food and a good time. Boy, were we wrong.  The server Robert was lifeless and rude.  Our food came out with , wrong sides, one plate came out with chicken when we ordered beef etc.  Robert the server at the end of the meal was more interested in how much tip he was going to get than how the customer service was.   All in all, OK food, but toooo pricey for what it is, and really bad customer service.  Will never be back to this place again.",0
"You know, when this place first opened (and I was there like, a half hour after they flung the doors open on their first day...) I was a total Alterra evangelist. The coffee was good, the internet free and blazing fast, the staff friendly and upbeat; in short, much of what you'd like in a cafe that charges more than the average for their food and caffeine. \n\nBut then the sheen started to wear off, and quick! I don't want to sandwich this review with the things I like, somethings needing improvement, and then ending with a pretty little bow saying something like, \""""but I still love this place!\"""" Read down, and you'll find plenty of that. \n\n1) Their hours. What? Why, in a city like Madison, and in such a central location, does Alterra close at 9:00? Why is it so much to ask for a cafe to stay open until like, 11:00? I know Barriques closes at 11 on Thursdays-Saturdays, but for some of us, we're just hitting our stride at 7:45PM, leaving us with less than 2 hours of good stride time. C'mon folks, let's keep some big-kid hours. \n\n2) The music is really really terrible. I mean, atrociously terrible. It's like your high school's collective mix CD's were dumped into a CD player and thrown on shuffle, and even features the irregular volume levels inherent in all those purloined tracks! In addition to being a total crapshoot of what kind of aural assault you're going to get, it's loud as all get out. On numerous occasions, I've gone up to the counter to ask them, like your dad always did to you, to turn it down. It's gotten to the point where, upon my approach, an employee will say: \""""Is it too loud? Should I turn it down?\"""" Yes. Yes it is too loud, and it takes over my noise-canceling headphones. And if you already know what I'm going to ask, that means you already know it's too loud. Just turn it down so conversations don't need to rise to scream-talking. \n\n3) Boy oh boy has the staff gotten surly. If you read my account of Johnson Public House, you'll know that I don't mind a bit of hipster-barista surliness with my coffee. It's par for the course... in *some* cafes. This is not the cafe. This is the bougie, over-priced, grown adult cafe. I'm paying more for my coffee than I would otherwise, and I expect the attitude to be dialed back. Granted, Alterra's management could be a right bear to work for, and may engender a surly staff, who knows? But if that's the case: ALTERRA MANAGEMENT: stop treating your employees poorly. They're unfriendly, and that makes me not want to come here. If it's just because they're bad at hiring people, and their staff thinks they're hot stuff 'cause they work at Alterra, then give me a break. \n\n4) On the employee tip, those bathrooms, single stall each, sure do get gnarly after a while. During the workaday week, there are typically lines out the door (I don't even want to know about what happens during the farmer's market... I avoid the square at all costs unless, you know, I'm at the market,) and that means that precious bathroom real estate (which often has lines rivaling the counter's,) gets trashed. Instead of standing around navel-gazing, it might be a good idea to check the bathrooms now and then. And maybe clean up after the circus has packed up and left? But instead, I see staff wandering about, seemingly aimlessly, all the while the bathrooms go untouched (making me not to want to touch them). And restock the creamer station while you're at it (and after changing gloves and scrubbing your paws, please.) I can't believe how many times I've gone over to get a straw or napkin and found the remains of what once was a supply bar. \n\nAnyway, there's my beef. I know we can't have everything all the time, but some things are easier had than others. And I think these are some low, low-hanging fruit.",0
"Really good all the way around. Decor is very nice and feels sort of upscale vs cheesy.  Great service, very attentive and knowledgeable. Most importantly - the food is good. Really haven't found better around here yet.  Maybe a tad pricey, but worth it because you will have leftovers.",1
"have been a customer for years as I was first introduced to Wally's when they first open by a very dear friend \""""Al\"""". At first opening they may have experienced a few growth pains but I was not aware of any and the food (lunch and dinner) I would put up against any fine restaurant like Wally's - and Wally's would be the clear winner. Remember reviews are that of one person (well intended I'm sure)  and may be as a result of only one visit so I think some of the negative comments I read should be taken with that in mind. My review is based on many visits over the years and is reflective of a composite of all those visits. The people/ staff at Wally's are outstanding - from ownership down to the newest hire. One thing I have noticed is turnover is a rarity at Wally's - speaks highly of the management and ownership in my opinion. Suggestion - if you have a bad experience give it another try just to confirm you didn't experience an \""""off day\"""". Thanks my story and I'm sticking to it  and no, I don't work there!!!",1
"Okay I have to give it two stars just because it really isn't much more than a nice Motel 6 or Best Western that is in Las Vegas.  With that said though I was completely shocked with my stay.  My wife and I stayed one night just to catch some sleep before me moved over to one of the other hotels on the strip, and I was fearing the worst.\n\nWe paid $20 for one night, and I closed my eyes while opening the door to my room, half expecting to find a room that would make me wish my wife would let us sleep in the car.\n\nThe room was quite clean, surprisingly decent sized, and the bed was even somewhat comfortable.  I would definitely NEVER stay here for more than one night, but if you need a place for a one night layover or looking for an incredibly cheap place to stay, you may want to check it out.",0
"Champaign is lucky to have multiple Korean restaurants but this one has the best food, ambiance and the only bathroom I would use!\n\nWe had my daughter's birthday dinner two years in a row at this restaurant and they could not have been more gracious and accommodating.   The steamed and fried dumplings were delicious and the bulgogi is my hands down favorite.  I recommend the multi grain rice, it has more flavor.  \n\nI am by no means an expert in Korean food but I sure know friendly and polite employees who work in a clean restaurant that serves tasty, fresh food.  Give it a try!",1
"Just because you name your restaurant after a hit movie (as for the movie-meh, I've experienced better) doesn't mean you can phone it in. On 3 different occasions, the service was indifferent to entirely missing, the food was uninspired, and on the last occasion, we had to send our food back THREE TIMES before they got it right (or at least how it is supposed to be according to the menu). \n\nThree strikes and you are out-I can't recommend this place.\n\nThere are waaay better places on Mill Ave (Crave leaps to mind)-even if you have to pay more (and that's a pretty tough trick, as this place isn't wallet friendly either). The Greek Pita at Tempe Marketplace makes this place an embarrassment. TRY HARDER!",0

"You know what's a good cure for the post Vegas strip hangover?\n\nPho.\n\nAnd that's exactly why I ordered Bun noodles instead.\n\nIn all seriousness Vegas' asian district has a decent pho place that attracts tourists and locals alike and according to my Vietnamese buddy who frequents Pho So 1 after many a crazy weekend, he says the Pho is alright.\n\nThey have a fairly extensive menu offering all manner of vietnamese dishes outside of the family soup & noodles like the aforementioned bun, and rice plates with pork chop, beef filet mignon, etc.  Also many chinese fusion dishes and some hot pot items also make the list.  \n\nThe restaurant is spacious and being off strip, parking is free and easy.  If you have a car and looking for some good, cheap eats, Pho So 1 is as good a choice as any.",1
"Rocket Subs & More opened about three weeks ago. It's hidden away in the Church's Chicken plaza at 35th avenue and Cactus. The boy and I were on our way to another sub shop today when we drove by this sub place, we made a quick executive decision to go here instead and pulled in.\n\nWalking in, there's the counter to order on your right, seating to the left, and cases of sodas and beverages along the back wall, with shelving for chips, corn nuts, etc. After some brief decision making, we decided to order a Rocket Dog combo meal (easy on the mustard and ketchup, with onions), and a Country Club sub, toasted.\n\nCombo meals here are awesome, you get chips or fries and a drink from their first case (cans of your everyday soda brands), for a dollar more, you can select a soda or drink from one of the other cases - and that is where the fun begins. They had TONS of different brands and flavors of sodas to choose from. I chose a Mason's root beer in a super cute glass bottle, and the boy chose Pepsi (boo - boring choice!).\n\nIt took less than 5 minutes for our food to be brought out to us. The sub? Amazingly toasted goodness - eat your heart out, Quizno's! My hot dog and fries were also awesome. The fries were well seasoned and crunchy, the hot dog made perfectly to order. :)\n\nThe owner swung by our table and asked how everything was (awesome, thanks!) and he also shared that starting next week they will be serving hamburgers and cheeseburgers.\n\nOverall, the food was awesome, the selection of drinks was great, and we will be back for more.\n\nLast, but certainly not least - the price? Great! For two sodas, a huge sub, a hot dog, and a giant side of fries it came to $11.00! :) \n\nBefore leaving we also took some sodas for the road (Captain Eli's Ginger Beer, anyone?)",1
"I dreaded having to do this someday, but I feel it's my duty to warn others that the food here is pretty disappointing. Won't go into detail about my subjective opinion of the quality, just avoid it. If the owners read this, I'd be happy to give fair, honest feedback on how they missed the mark.\nI give 5 stars to the style/color and the addition of a deck.\nSpeaking Spanish was helpful when ordering and helping convey that my brother is allergic to dairy. The waiter appreciated it and my brother initially felt at ease.\n\nI'll probably go back for margs and modelo on tap cuz they do have pretty good prices on them.",0
"Airport itself was fine, fairly clean and new, nice Southwest Skycap service outside.\n\nTSA at this place was horrible though - I get it can be a frustrating job, especially if a fair number of the passengers are non-English speakers, but that is no reason to berate them.  A couple of the staff were much more engaged in making fun of those that didn't understand than keeping the line moving.  So not only did I feel like they weren't paying attention to the security issues, they were just plain mean.  No dialogue, just yelling more and louder at people who didn't know the routine or immediately comply.\n\nI fly a fair amount, and usually encounter agents that treat you with respect if you do the same - not the case here.",0
"I am not sure how the food or drinks are at this place because they were so understaffed, we were unable to get a beer. After putting our name in, we went to the bar and waited for at least 10 minutes and could not get any service. There was one bartender and she was working hard. I cannot believe this place would be short staffed on a Saturday night. There was a Spring Training game that night, too and only a couple of places to grab a bite prior to the game. One would think there would be several bartenders on a night like this. We decided to leave and probably not come back.",0
"YOUFIt Chandler - THANK GOD MY DEBT CARD EXPIRED!!!!  I joined and 10 months into my membership, my card expired  I was no longer using facility so went in the following month to cancel.  Paid 2 months dues and 25 cancellation fee and signed paperwork.  A few weeks later I started getting text on my phone that my membership was past due.   Called and was told over the phone they would talk to Manager and push it through.  Text continued,  Went in  and was told my cancellation was pending and manager would take care of and they had me sign another cancellation form.\n\nText continued so my husband went in, they still showed in their system that I canceled but had it marked pending.  He signed more paperwork to cancel my membership.  Again started getting phone calls three months after I canceled and it was a law firm stating I owed YOUFIT $167.00!!!!!  I was livid.  I explained to them I had canceled and they wanted to know if i had paperwork.  I  said no, but I have my receipt where I paid up including cancellation fee but I never received copies of cancellation notices that  we signed.  They said they needed copies.\n\nCalled YOUFIT again and finally had to go down there and talk to manager Joey.  After din-king around, they finally agreed that I had canceled back in April.  I asked them to call collection attorney and he said they could not do that.  We asked for paperwork and were told there was not paperwork he could give us to show collection attorney, but he would take care of it.\n\nI called collection law firm on the spot and explained that I was at the club, was told no paper to show proof and would they talk to manager.. I forced the manager to talk to collection attorney. \nWhen we left there we were promised that it would all be taken care of.  I received a follow up voice mail the following day from Manager that it was all cleared up with collection attorney.  WHAT A MESS\n\nAfter researching I see that BBB has given them an F rating in Florida for same issues.  If my card had not expired and I tried to cancel, the draws would have gone on and on and one.  I would suggest if this happens get a new debit card or close down checking account.  It such poor business practice.\n\nMy husband is still a member  but thinks after all this he will cancel his membership this  year.  I told him to start now because it will take at least the rest of the year to finally get it stopped.  NEVER AGAIN",0
"Tasting menu at $22 per person was absolutely fantastic! Let the chef take control, it's the way to go. Fresh ingredients, well-presented, and the staff were super friendly and efficient. As mentioned in other reviews we loved the music, as well. The perfect summer treat in a really cool neighborhood. Can't praise this place enough!",1
Way too expensive for the type of food they serve. Even the domestic micros are at least a dollar more expensive per pint than just about anywhere else in Pittsburgh. Do yourself a favor and take your dollars elsewhere where they will go much farther.,0
* COFFEE AND ALCOHOL *\n\ni wonder if the coffee and alcohol trend started in phoenix.  saw several impressively spacious coffee cafes with coffee on one side and alcohol on the other. starbucks must be copying them since they are going to sell alcohol.\n\nplenty of seating. this is a wonderful place to grab drinks to catch up with friends. we tried the cold brew since it was HOT out (and only march!!). it had good flavor but was slightly watered down.  they roast and sell their own beans. the roaster is onsite. \n\nthere is a sign that says no smoking within 25 feet on the front door.  but of course people were hanging out in front within 10 ft.  i'd love for cops to be able to give tickets for that!!\n\nthere is a parking lot and street parking available.,1
"I've been going to this gas station for about nine months. My wife has been going there much longer. \n\nIt depends on timing. It's not the easiest to get in and out of. If you're headed North on Hualapai, it's very easy. However, heading South, you have to make a U-Turn on Sahara. When exiting you have to make a right onto Sahara, then make a left on Hualapai at the signal. \n\nMost of the employees leave a lot to be desired. The guy with the lips tattooed on his neck, will drop a male customer for a woman at the drop of a hat.  Most of them act like they just don't care! The exceptions are the soft spoken Grey haired guy, and the dark curly haired guy. \n\nIf they did an Undercover Boss episode on Rebel Oil Company, the guy with the curly hair would either get a job heading Training, or he'd run his own location.\n\nA bad experience I had was a discrepancy in cost. I fueled up there one day, when the sign said $3.29 per gallon... Once I'd gone in and paid, I realized the cost on the pump was $3.34 per gallon. I'll never buy gas there again! \n\nWhen I was there tonight, the beer I normally buy didn't have a price marked, and I feel that I was over charged. \n\nFrom now on, I'll be going to the Cheveron on Town Center, and Twain... It's closer to my house, easier access, and I've never had issues.",0
"The front door man told me it would be a certain amount to get in the door, then when I went to pay the woman inside charged way less. Seems like the door man was just trying to make extra cash. The place wasn't that busy at all, and I didn't like the music. It definitely wasn't worth the cover. I have a much better time at free clubs in Old Town with better music.",0
"This vet went downhill when all of the vets left a couple of years ago.  We really liked the vets they had, but had not so great experiences with the new vets.  The staff is really great, but a lot of them left as well.  When more than half the staff leave makes me wonder if there are some issues at the higher levels.",0
"The gray-haired ASSHOLE at the end of the Circus of Horrors smelt like PISS and he was VERY, VERY, VERY NASTY!! Plus...he had all the people backed up and was totally yelling at everyone! And it WAS NOT part of the act!!! We waited there forever for the \""""wonderful finale  of the PATHETIC  GORILLA!  You guys JUMPED THE SHARK!!!",0
"Horrible company. I reserved a full size sedan, they didn't say anything at the counter they are out of sedans and stuck me with a jeep suv. \n\nCalling it  \""""upgrade\"""". When I found out and asked them to give me the Camry parked next to the jeep. The attendant said the Camry is going to auction. Yea right. The jeep was the worst car I ever driven. It is bouncy and the turn signal doesn't even work properly.",0
"It's 1 am, you are just coming down from a terrific high and you are ready for some doughnuts.  Where do you go?  This place!  Me and three of my friends once went here and ordered two dozen doughnuts.  We ate them all on the way home!\nMy first purchase from this place was a humongous apple turnover in 1976.  It was after a Kansas concert.  I have been going back ever since.  The doughnuts continue to be as good as ever.",1
"Take-out is sooooooo slow. Told me would be 20 minutes (which is on the long side for take-out already), got there after 25 minutes, and waited at least another 15-20 minutes for the food to be ready. And this is on a week night at 9pm. \n\nThe food wasn't out of the world either, the yuzu salmon was fishy and did not meet expectation since I saw so many good reviews about it on Yelp. \n\nProbably won't be returning, there are so many sushi options in Vegas that are better, cheaper, and faster.",0
"A fairly underwhelming selection of football products. The store is somewhat small, so I am sure inventory concerns impact the product line. Maybe it is just me, but I don't think it would be too challenging to identify customer interest and offer products to fit the need.  \n\nBaseball season is winding down, so a reduction in baseball products would make sense. Have some minimal offerings for Diamondbacks and a couple of teams that might actually make the playoffs. The majority of people shopping now most likely are interested in football. For the Cardinals, 95% of people who want a regular Cardinals jersey already have one, so focus on the new black alternative jersey (which they did have a nice selection at $80 for a replica and $110 for an authentic). \n\nBesides Cardinals products, college football would be a main focus. With schools back in session and the college schedule starting last week that is probably a high interest product right now. In the crazy scheme to make money, I would expect sporting goods stores to have a big selection right now. And considering most people are not from here, a selection of other schools would be nice to see. Again, given the size of the store the number of schools would be limited and I probably would not find my Marshall Thundering Herd on the shelf, but it should be more than only ASU and AU. \n\nHaving went to Dicks, Champs and the Sports Chalet only to discover none of them had jerseys except a couple offering ASU or AU, I went back to Just Sports. No jerseys, but they did have a few t-shirts. Again, mostly ASU with some AU - then I stumbled on a Wake Forest shirt. That seemed odd...but soon I found a handful of other schools. It was all the same design of shirt, which resembled only slightly higher quality than a Tent City screen-print station, but for my needs it would have to do. I flipped through the one rack about four times hoping something would jump out. Finally worker A tore himself away from the conversation with worker B and asked if I was looking for a particular team. When I said yeah, one that doesn't suck, he only offered the comments \""""Good luck\"""". The shirts were decently priced - $20 for 2 or $12.99 for one, but the selection made it a challenge to find one - let alone two.",0
"Nice environment. Plenty of TVs and decent decor, they also have a patio area. Food was alright, the French dip seemed like it had really cheap roast beef on it. The fries were good though. Worst part was the service, waitress seemed to have a bad attitude the whole time. Then when we asked her if she would honor a coupon that we had received from our apartment complex when we just moved it, she made a big deal about it and said she would have to talk to a manager. Ok... So she comes back and says they will honor the expired coupon but that I need to tell them to stop handing these coupons out. Seriously? Not going back...",0

"I started going to LA Fitness a few years ago when they bought out Ballys.  The only reason I keep going there is because I have a low rate locked in.  I've been to 2 other locations in Pittsburgh (North Hills and East Liberty) and this is definitely my least favorite.  The equipment is nice and they will validate your parking in the garages--I can't really think of anything else positive.  The gym is packed with college age kids. I have no idea why they choose to pay $35 a month here instead of going to the free university gym.   The first floor smells OK.  Try to breathe through your mouth if you're on the 2nd floor in the summer.  The locker rooms are pretty dirty and usually packed.    If you're not comfortable around  crowds definitely stay away in peak hours.  LA Fitness corporate really pushes their sales people  to keep their gyms at maximum capacity.  They know how cheap Pittsburghers are so they will deal with it.   I also would advise some noise-canceling headphones because the music (Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, etc.) is really loud.  It's not a terrible place, but they do deserve all these bad reviews.",0
"I'm not going to lie, I was a bit frightened when I walked in for the first time. I felt like it was 1950, and I was oddly dressed because of my... jeans. It looked like an old-fashioned diner, which, I'm assuming, is the look it's supposed to have.\n\nAnyway, my first experience was decent. The waitress came around just enough times to serve me water and bring out my spaghetti that was a bit on the watery side. Side note: I don't understand how restaurants fail to properly drain noodles.\n\nThe second experience was awful. I'm pretty sure my waiter forgot about me as I was seated in what I like to call the \""""uncool\"""" section. I was tempted to get up and serve myself water because it got to the point where I thought his shift ended. Like my first experience, I ordered pasta, which was decent.\n\nI haven't been back there in a while, and I'm not too sure I'll return any time soon.",0
"I really wanted to like this place because it looks great and they had awesome beer selections, but the service was so strange that the experience was almost surreal. \n \nWe walked in with 7 people and asked for a table.  The host said there would be a wait, which was totally fine considering our party size, but refused to give us any kind of estimate of how long the wait would be, other than \""""it could be a while.  Anywhere  from 15 minutes to an hour.  I just don't know.\""""  After trying a few times to figure out what \""""a while\"""" meant, we decided to get beers at the bar while we waited.  \nAbout 15-20 minutes later, we were finishing our beers and discussing how strange it was that the host refused to give us any kind of wait estimate, when he walked up behind us and said \""""you know I can hear you talking about me, right?\""""\nWe chatted about how it would be nice to get an approximate time, even if it was an overestimate, and he agreed at first, but said he didn't want to give us too much of a wait because he didn't want us to leave.  I told him that it wasn't his decision whether we stayed or left, and that we just wanted an honest estimate.  The host then started to complain to us about two girls sitting at a large booth who had apparently been there for a few hours, and had paid 45 minutes before, but hadn't left yet.\nHe then told us that a table should be ready when \""""those two guys finally leave\"""" pointing and at a table of guys within ear shot. \nWe decided not to take the table and leave, at which point he offered us 3 other occupied tables to try and keep us there.  I've never experienced such an unprofessional host.\nAlso, I find it really strange that there are no beer prices on the wall or on the paper menu.  Like most customers, I'd like to know about how long the wait is and how much I'm going to pay.",0
"Watched Dita Von Tease at House of Blues. May 17th 2012 : The show started 20 minutes late, since it is standing room only tickets at $45-55 a pop and we had to arrive at least 30 minutes early so it is not very pleasant. A total of 50 minutes standing time and some audiences were sitting on the dirty floor... Once the show started it was disappointing and not worth the wait at all. What a waste of life and time this was! I didn't know a fat woman twirling nipple tassels is entertainment!? The MC told us the more we drank the better the show becomes and prettier the women too. I understand HOB started the show late so they can sell more drinks, but it is not fair to the audiences. Only thing nice about that place is the chandelier, I had the chance to stare at it for 50 minutes.",0
"Great place to go when downtown. There is usually a coupon in the paper.  The food is fairly priced and good.  if you are going to the Smith Center, they give you $10 off/person!!! It's a great deal and very convenient if you are going to the show.",1
"Monday night, Tuesday night, Friday night. Doesn't matter; the food always takes FOREVER. We ordered a small pizza with some sides of ranch, and they actually never showed up.... Seriously?",0
"The orange blossom beer is great and the staff is friendly enough. However, waiting 2 hours for your food is unacceptable and I would only recommend this place to people who want to hang out for a while and drink beer.",0
"Searched Yelp for a Taco Tuesday and found Christina's.  $1.25 for a taco and very tasty.  Ordered 4 shredded beef tacos and a soda for $6.50.  Absolutely great red salsa, the green was heavy garlic but the red hit all the right buttons.  Chips brought out as a first made this place a step above a hole in the wall at great value.  I'll be back",1
"Ate here last night for dinner for what was sadly the last time, in all honesty. Used to LOVE this place, but it has gone downhill dramatically over the past year or so.\n\nEvening was off to a bad start when a runner to the bar felt the need to walk *between* my wife and I rather than simply walking around is in the otherwise spacious lobby area.\n\nOnce seated we placed our order for apps and dinner. Apps were fine. Salads are now 1/2 the size they used to be but 30% higher price. I could almost excuse this if it weren't for the rest of the evening...\n\nWife's dinner came out promptly... And cold. Sent it back and was told my meal would be right out. My dinner arrived 10 minutes later. Wife's lukewarm meal returned 5 minutes after that. Waitress finally arrived where I had to ask for grated Parmesan for my meal that was on the way to being finished. Asked for a refill on iced tea. 10 minutes later had to ask for iced tea again.\n\nVery disappointed that this place has declined so noticeably. Hate to say it, but this was our last visit. A longtime customer has had enough of being let down.",0

"The best part about this hotel was that it was 100% smoke free and had no casino!!!  It was a nice escape from the craziness of the casino floors.  Unfortunately it was tucked back a little off the strip behind the Fashion Show Mall.  We often cut through Nordstroms and exited through Bloomingdales and made our way out to the strip.  \n\nThe hotel itself is gorgeous!  The rooms are spacious and even the non-strip view rooms have great views.  The pool is heated and the deck is great in the morning with the sunlight directly on it!  Staff was kind and helpful!\n\nThere's no shuttle service to and from the airport, but there is a shuttle that runs to the Wynn and Caesars.  It runs regularly and makes for a quick trip.  \n\nPurchased the rooms on hotwire for $125/night.  Another negative is that there is a resort fee that you pay upon check out.  Probably not really necessary at all.",1
"The Fremont Street Experience has turned into a dump of nothing more then street beggars, drunks, homeless and thieves.  Not children friendly at all as it is very dirty with a host of inappropriate street performers.  There are so many other places to spend your money!\n\nI will never go there again.",0
"Dined here for lunch on 6/25/11.  Ordered their chicken cordon bleu sandwich and tomato soup.  Tomato soup was very good!  Not tangy at all.  Very rich and creamy.  :)  $8 bucks for a cup of soup.  WTH? The sandwich was good, but the $16 dollar price tag that came along with it was not.  Overall, food here is yummy, but for the price you are paying it is not worth it.  There are so many places to dine at in Vegas for far better prices.  If you have money to burn, then by all means, dine here. However,  my suggestion, Yelp around first  :)",0
"Came here while on a recent vacay in Vegas... Primarily came as I'm a big Bobby Flay fan. Overall enjoyed the food but have to say it wasn't as good as Mesa Grill. This place overall ranked as a nice fast food type of place. Similar to hook burger in LA. However that being said service was excels  and staff were friendly. The food was good but fries and onion rings didn't stand out from any other place I've had them. Ordered the grill cheese for myself which was perfect - crisp bread, gooey cheeses really well made. The wifey had a turkey burger but thought is was over cooked...would recommend if you're hankering for a quick bite but can't really say this one hit it out of the park.",1
"BWW is one of those places where you have to know what they are good at, and focus on that. BWW is good for: wings, bar food, beer, and the game. That's about it. If you're expecting gourmet burgers, look elsewhere. If you want a place to watch all of the games and get reliably decent wings, they hold up. \n\nAre they the best? No. Still, I never have to guess about what I'm going to receive, and the quality of the product they do best is quite good. If you go for lunch, sit at the bar and get one of the specials. Not bad for under $10 with a drink.",1
"Came here on a particularly icy, cold night to meet up with some fellow Yelpers to get our collective Indian on. Despite the somewhat tacky interior and warbling Bollywood on the tv, the place was fairly full and as soon as I opened the door, all I could think of was getting some saag paneer and beer into my gob.\n\nEach one of our 8 people ordered something differed: 2 types of paneer, a yummy cauliflower dish, tikka chicken, some goat and enough naan to feed a small country. \n\nThe service was fast and friendly, the beer was cheap and the total bill was ridiculously cheap. I would definitely come back here and I only wish that it was closer to my house. Question though, does he show the Catherine Deneuve photo to everyone that dines here? ha ha",1
"My animals are my life so I'm always nervous taking any of them into a new Vet.  But Dr. John Stephens was awesome.  The technician was also very compassionate but I didn't catch his name.  My dog was adopted at two years of age and has always been very scared and nervous, especially around males.  Both the technician and Dr. were very patient with her which I really appreciated.  They answered all my questions and explained everything thoroughly.  I felt the prices were fair and never felt like I was being taken advantage of or undergoing unnecessary testing.  I definitely found my new Vet.",1
"This location just opened where the Island's Burger used to be by Raintree and the 101.  They deserve an above average rating for the great service.  They were well staffed with people who knew what they were doing and wanted very much to please.  The pizza's not Bianco's, but it's good, and there's a lot to be said for being well taken care of without any bs.",1
"Food was good, but beware of prices.  La santisima down the street offers a very similar food and drink experience for about a quarter of the price.  Very good though...",1
"I have a soft spot for Brasseries. And burgers. So this place was an immediate win for me. I have to say, I think Chelsea's burger was a little better, but I bet a lot of people would disagree with me. Chelsea's is just a great burger - the way you expect a burger to be. The Metro has an amazing fancy burger. ;) Which as also absolutely delicious. It just depends on what you're in the mood for. I LOVE the atmosphere as well. The wait staff was very nice. The other customers were nice, and we wandered around Scottsdale aferwards. All in all, a great place. A friend mentioned that they have a fantastic brunch, so I'll be back for that.",1
Well we tried it.  The veal and ribeye extremely tough. A very cheap cut of meat.  The price was $32 for each dish very expensive for a local type pizzeria. Not a very good one. My husband ordered the veal stuffed with cheese. Both meals where equally bad. Save your time and money. Servers were nice food was terrible. I wonder if the food and beverage directors taste their own product.,0
"I've been here three times now, and consistently...this place serves the best burgers I've ever had. It's expensive for hamburgers, but worth it. I actually look forward to visiting this place whenever I'm in Vegas because I haven't really found a place closer to home where I can grab a burger this good. The wait can take a while, but once you're seated...the service is usually pretty quick. Try one of the shakes....they're great too.",1
This place is the best I go here maybe twice a week on average and I love this place. If you come in be friendly and you will always get friendly service and great food. I always get something not on the menu and the have no problem doing what I want. The food is ALWAYS good!,1
"Wow...what a place.  It's tiny, interesting looking interior-wise with chocolate walls and low lighting that make everyone look good.  Walls are lined with banquettes -- and tables in the middle can be pushed together for large groups -- but remember, this place is tiny, and the tables don't turn quickly at all.  We were there for two and a half hours and only 1 table left.  The only \""""leaving\"""" is when folks head outside to smoke.\n\nWhat I loved was that my husband had taken a group here a few weeks ago (Brett below) was with him...and they had a monumental meal that made him feel guilty he'd not taken me first so we went last night and I thought it was spectacular with one lapse in service and food to knock one star off 5, but it was still dynamite.  \n\nThey were out of unfiltered sake which made him pout, but our server made an excellent recommendation on a bottle that we loved -- only problem was it went down too easily, and since they were low, wouldn't sell us a second...mid meal....\n\nStarted with skewered cherry tomatoes -- lightly salted that were still amazingly cool in the center.  We both could have eaten a pound of these.  We had a Japanese version of Caprese salad that blew my mind -- seaweed for basil, sliced tomatoes, the creamiest tofu ever for mozzarella and for interest on top - and to take it so over the top that I was in awe -- teeny tiny baby eels that were fried to crispy sprinkled lightly on top.  He sprinkled green tea salt on the top and I was blown away.  \n\nThe sashimi salad with tuna and salmon, spinach and dressing of soy, yuzu and crispy shallots was to die for on such a hot night.\n\nThen we had fried octopus -- wow.  Flavors that exploded in your mouth -- really satisfying and so simple.\n\nWhole fried crispy shrimp were great and made for great comedy at the table -- a la Bean on vacance in France a la gare...  If you saw the movie, you'll get the reference since you eat these whole -- we liked them much more than Bean did. \n\nThis was where things fell apart -- where we'd had food coming out -- small plates -- timed perfectly...suddenly the brakes hit hard and the whole restaurant came to a standstill.  I jokingly said mused that the chef left to buy cigarettes...because seriously nothing came out of the kitchen for about 30 minutes.  \n\nThen magically, things slowly began to fire again...next we had foie gras skewers, terrific baby lamb chops and some Raku seaweed and turnips, then some lovely chicken thighs, then a special dashi broth with snapper, shitake mushrooms, japanese eggplant and a lovely okra...Then out came two of my favorites -- a chawanmushi with duck and foie gras and dashi broth -- yowza...absolutely mind blowing.  The flavor combination was amazing -- the smokey duck, the sweetness of the dashi, the creaminess of the cusard, the richness of the foie...just terrific...then skewers  of shishito peppers  -- if you've never had these and you like green chilis these rock.   \n\nThen we had one final dish that interestingly was my least favorite -- ground chicken on chopsticks that looked like corndogs but had oddly very little flavor...  or maybe I'd hit the wall...either way, we were officially maxed out -- the bill -- huge -- $240 before tip -- but that was with $100 in sake alone -- and the plates while numerous, were very very tiny...\n\nBut we loved it and I highly recommend checking it out... In true izakaya fashion this place is open late.  Go with friends to taste and try everything -- order pitchers of beer, sake, have fun.  It's a great addition to town.",1

"Ate breakfast here before my flight. I really expected more.  The service was terrible.  The egg white sandwich on a pretzel roll sounded great, but it was very poor.

"Pho Little Saigon is 24/7!  It's not fancy, you go up to pay after, but that's pretty standard with most pho places.  The menu is extensive, and there are photos on the walls.  I got either a #15 or a #17, I can't remember but I know it was one or the other and it was good.  Really good broth, very hot, very satisfying. My friend and I weren't feeling so great and it cleared our sinuses. We shared spring rolls with shrimp and this peanut sauce.  I wasn't feeling shrimp when I walked in but this was clean, it was perfect.  I also got a thai iced tea and it wasn't overly sweet.  I almost forgot, this place is cash only! Bring money.",1
"The coke is $4 for a red plastic party cup. Enough said. I should've known though since this place was in Cosmo. The pizza was nothing special, and I felt like I could've gotten the same thing from dominos. It was soggy, greasy, and just meh flavored..",0
"ARRRGGGGHHHHH! When Restaurant John's closed and was taken over by other folk there was much mourning. But I thought, as friends were going there for brunch, I'd join them and see how it was doing several months after the take-over. \nMy friends waited more than 40 minutes for their food. I waited 30 minutes for 2 eggs over easy and sausage. The baked beans were dreadful. The toast was almost cold. There were 4, count 'em, 4 one inch by one inch pieces of melon as \""""fruit\"""". The comfy banquettes have been ripped out for hard chairs and everything is brown - dark brown-  including the dying plant in the corner. JUST what I want to see while eating. The presentation was dreadful, even for a casse-croute. The \""""waitress\"""" was invisible and some poor creature kept coming around every 5 minutes asking us if we wanted more coffee or water BUT she couldn't take our order or do anything else.  The place, which used to be jumping on a Saturday, was almost deserted. Another couple nearly walked out because their food was so late. No wonder the place was empty.\nStay away from this disaster and remember the good days of the real John's.",0
"My first time visit as recommended by my friend, who is a regular. I had the Tavern burger..and it was delicious...cooked to perfection.

I  positively will go again and bring some new friends with me.\nEven though the place was jam packed on Saturday night the service was top notch.\nWe sat outside on the patio because it was a nice cool night which is a rare thing in August.",1
"I would give it 100 stars if I could!! I am a life long Washingtonian and Sea Hawks fan. 5 of us were in Vegas for a combination birthday trip and after a quick Google search we decided that Scooters would be the place to go watch the Hawks VRS.Falcons game. What a show! The Las Vegas Seahawkers club was top notch and VERY welcoming. Under the advice of a bartender that I spoke with a few days before the game we made sure to arrive a few hours early and we had the privilege of sitting by some of the club officers. What a GREAT group of people! If you are a Hawks fan and want the same type of high energy hawk madness you will find in Seattle this is the place to go.\n\nAlso $9 pitchers of beer and HUGE meals for under $10!!!! Beautiful servers who do incredibly well for the amount of people they have to tend to. The $25 dollar cab ride from Harrah's was well worth it.\n\nJust one more testament to the type of people in the bar one brave soul came in wearing red pants and an Atlanta Falcons jersey. He was hazed but treated well and after the game and a big snafu with the cab service he offered and took the 5 of us to our hotel. Talk about  SPORTSMANSHIP!!!!\n\nGreat people, great food, great prices, just a great time!!!!\n\n\nSEAHAWKS!!!!!!!!",1

"Sub par rooms (bugs and very outdated), poor service are the two most glaring faults of this hotel. While they advertise new and renovated rooms most are not. Combined with the fact that the rates are far too expensive for what you'd expect make this hotel worth 1 star. The only saving grace are the nice grounds and pool. Would not stay again.",0

"With all the positive posts, I was shocked at our experience.  Restaurant was VERY crowded.  2 hour wait.  Had reservations, were seated promptly.  Small table in the back..okay..here for a \""""romantic\"""" dinner with hubby...no problem.  Ishmel, our waiter, promptly comes over to greet.  Explains that things were crazy, did we mind taking it slow.  Cool with us.  We're here to enjoy our evening.  \n\nLet me say that I am a foodie and an experienced Italian food person.  Have had the real thing, the American version, the fast food version, and the extremely bad version.  I know the difference.\nPlaced our drink order.  While we waited, received Fried Ravioli as a first time customer gift...it just was okay. Olive Garden has better.\nIshmel came back for our order.  Ordered Calamari as an appetizer, my husband ordered a Caesar Salad and Chicken Alfredo.  I asked about the Veal Marsala vs the Chef's special Beef Tenderloin.  Ishmel recommended the Veal and then house wine.  Wine was excellent.  Veal was just okay.  I have had better at Portofino's and Olive Garden.  Not the best Marsala sauce.   Caesar Salad okay.  Calamari..not as good as Lotus. Just okay.\n\nAs for taking things \""""slow\""""...we received our appetizer and salad together, barely got that finished when the main course came out. Had good service.  They were very crowded and busy.  Food was not up to par from previous review.  Portifinos is much better overall.  So is Olive Garden.  Will not be back.  Next  time, we'll go to Villa Antonio for quality Italian food.",0
"We went to Craftsteak on Christmas Day for dinner. We had eight people in our party, so we were able to sample a variety of items. We had reservations at 5:45 pm and were seated promptly. \nSetting: the restaurant itself was very attractive and pleasant.\nNoise level: average for a higher end restaurant.\nWait staff: Friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. Were not overly intrusive and were willing to split the bill in half, giving us two separate charges.\nFood: Very good to excellent. Tried veal, ribeye (both the individual 16 oz and the 32 oz, bison, hanger steak, and veal. Got the quail, Maui onions, asparagus, sweet potato and mashed potatoes. The dessert was chocolate, monkey bread, and sorbet. As mentioned overall the food was terrific. The only marginal item was the bison. Three people ordered the bison and one of the three was bit overcooked. The best item was the hanger steak, really juicy, tender, and tasty. Having been Ruth Chris, Morton's, and a variety of high end steakhouse in our local area, I think that the quality of the food (main course and sidedishes) at Craftsteak is a least one or two notches above these other establishments.\nCost: Average of $80 per person-without any alcohol.\nIn summary, if you want a really good steak and are willing to pay the price, Craftsteak is a good choice.\nThe four stars is for the quality of the food (very high) and the cost(also very high). Would have given it 5 stars if the cost had been $10-20 less per person.",1
"I go here all the time and I love it!  Such great ambiance for such a little place, always cozy and fun to stop in here for a bite.  The tapas are all perfectly spicy or fruity or whatever they want them to be - I usually order a variety every time I go.  The ceviche is great on hot days.  Also a big fan of the repollo relleno.  The desserts are awesome as well, especially the guava empanadas (just let them cool down before you bit into them!).  I don't usually order the meals, but when I have, they have been very good.  I am definitely more a fan of just ordering a bunch of tapas.  Also, great mojitos and sangria!  Very cute and pleasant place.  Great service, very friendly people.",1
I have been going to RZ Salon for a decade. I pay the high prices because when Amy wants to she can really give a great cut. IT IS hit or miss though. I often feel I should apologize to Amy for just being there. Today I could not take her attitude any more. I felt talking to her briefly about how to cut my hair was impossible. She was rude and dismissed  me. She started cutting my hair though we were at odds with what she was going to do. I had to leave. If you want to pay $70 for a haircut I'd suggest going someplace that will be nice too. Amy's shampoo is nothing special either.,0
"My husband and I went here on a Tuesday night after reading the reviews on here. That time the service was Excellent food cooked to perfection...except I don't know why everyone raves about The Twice Baked Potatoes here. It was hard as a rock and hardly any potato to eat inside. The wine selection is less to be desired. Despite all this, when our very dear friend came to Las Vegas to visit we wanted to take him here. Bob Taylor's is Not the type of Lux steak house our friend is used to, but he was excited to see just this type of sawdust joint. This time went on a Monday night. It took someone 20 mins just to come over and ask if someone was taking care of us. We were standing up and leaving when she finally came over to the table. Our friend ORDERD the Calamari. It was the only thing he ended up eating that night. He ORDERD the porterhouse steak MEDIUM. The entire thing was WAAAAYYY OVER COOKED. Well done is an understatement. My filet was fine but my Lobster Tail was WAAAAYYY OVER COOKED. Flaking apart, not wet n juicy. So we politely asked to send them back. She brought out my new Lobster Tail. Perfect! Well 35 minutes later our friends Porterhouse STILL had not come out!!! When it finally did arrive, it was RAW!! Like really really raw. Like the cook just threw it on to seer the outside on both sides but the inside was completely RAW!! Gross!!! It's like we were in the movie WAITING. So, my friend was disgusted, we were embarrassed anD asked for the check. All she did was not charge for the Steak, and take the Calamari off the bill. \nI would've given one more star but we won't be going back here since the cooks don't a crap about how your food comes out they'd just rather close the kitchen. I might add we were there 3 hours before closing time...and a party of 8 DRUNK people stumbled through the door about 5 mins before we left. Also won't be going back because management doesn't care either since we asked to speak with a manager and were told by our server that there wasn't one on the shift. It's too bad bc other than my twice baked potato on the first time went, we thought we had found our new favorite place to go and bring all our friends and family. Oh well",0
"Went with my wife.\n\nSo I couldn't be all that I could be.  But this was a great place, I can't wait to go back.",1
"I love this little quaint restaurant! Have had great food and experience every time I've gone for lunch.  The chipotle chicken is my fav!! I wish there was more inside seating, for when it gets super hot, but outside seating was great for good weather.",1
"Very cheerful, upbeat atmosphere. Excellent service. There is a huge screen that usually shows sports for the fans. And, a happy hour that makes the food significantly cheaper. If you are wanting to listen to modern Irish jigs while eating delicious food (who doesn't?!), read on.\n\nI've ordered a number of appetizers and dishes here. The cod and pork sliders are by far the best. There are also wings, fries and Irish-style pizzas, and tacos, among other dishes. If you are a first-timer, make sure you go during happy hour (4 pm to 7 pm) and order pork tacos and cod sliders; you won't regret it. God, I'm salivating just thinking about going back.",1
"Went in for breakfast the first morning we were at the Paris, and although there was a line to get a table, we were seated in respectable time.  That's about where the positives ended.\nI ordered the fruit platter and bacon strips with a coffee.  Waiter never brought half&half even though I requested 3 times, each time he walked by to be exact.  Finally I had to ask a bus-boy for it, whom brought it promptly.  \nThe waiter had no idea what most of the items on the menu were.  My cousin asked about the beignets, he said he wasn't sure how they were. (no problem)  When it arrived, he brought out MUFFINS and when we questioned it, he said those were how they make beignets at this restaurant (apparently a French restaurant in a French themed hotel).  \nAfter pointing out (via photos on our phones) that these are not beignets, he brings out a new dish, this time donut holes.  Cold ones, to be exact, with the center of the pastries still a bit uncooked.  No beignets, not once.  Coffee was cold, my bacon was cold.  Just all in all, food wasn't the best.  Maybe it was our selections by sour chance, because other Yelpers seem to like the other menu selections.\nThe icing on the donut hole came when we paid our bill with cash and the waiter questioned our tip to us.  Such lack of class, I would except better of a \""""sit down\"""" \""""French\"""" restaurant in a 4 star Vegas hotel, Center Strip.  Next time, use Yelp! and (if you drove your own car like we did) go eat off the strip, ESPECIALLY breakfast.  Or do a buffet.",0
"The servings are just way too big, and I feel like the burgers are mostly bun for how much they cost. The food isn't really substantial enough to enjoy next-day either, which is a bummer because I love leftovers. The beer selection is good but pretty expensive, depending on what you get (some drinks are on-par with competing venders, but others are inexplicably $1 or $2 more, which adds up pretty quickly). The veggie burger is pretty decent, especially the one with all the fixins, but there isn't all that much to offer vegetarians or vegans. Typically, after I eat here I feel like garbage and all my money is gone. It's a good place to go once a year for a change of pace to remember why I always end up back at Pipers across the street.",0
"I went twice, the first time I thought it was me, but basically if I wanted to be treated like cattle I would have gone to a stock yard. Its a meat shop in there and I wondered about the cleanliness as I watched the techs and the movement of tools. I would rather turn down business then treat people like cattle.I go to get my nails done as a special time for myself, not to be squeezed in and rushed.",0
"I have to say the store is very nice.  It is well displayed and very appealing.  The problem is the staff and customer service.  I went to the store twice looking to purchase new ski gear for my wife and I and our two kids, both times I was there I left after about 10 minuets because I was never acknowledged by the staff of about 6 people working.  I ended up going to Sport Chalet and purchasing four full sets of equipment ($3,500).  I try to shop local and independent retailers (especially for big purchases), but the folks at Mcghies acted like they didn't want my money.",0
"Well, it isn't paradise.  \nBland mac and cheese, so bland, that a full bite couldn't be choked down.\nMatzah ball soup - flavorful enough.\n\nI wouldn't make a trip to the LVH just for this restaurant.  In fact, if other restaurants in LVH were open at 9pm, I wouldn't have chosen to dine here, either. \n\nBut, I did hear they have a good breakfast.",0

WOW WOW WOW!!!! I observed a Contract Writing Class taught by David Compton at this school! It was the BEST class EVER! The 6hr class went by soooo FAST! This man is a wealth of information!

"I've been taking my puppy to this place for over 7 months now.  I spent a lot of time researching options before choosing them and am so happy with my choice!  We typically see Dr Jennifer Johnson and she is kind, funny and smart.  We also saw Dr MacKenzie once and he was great, too.  Plus, each person on their staff, from the assistants to the front desk, has been helpful and nice.  Love everything about them :)",1
"Fantastic, delicious, top quality burgers and interesting and tasty  specialty beers at excellent prices. Highly recommend.",1
"Skip the sushi and stick to cooked food and rolls.\n\nWe had just come from watching a movie and were starving. We were looking for some quick and cheap grub and I remembered this Kobe location that was near us. I have been to the one on Rainbow on numerous times, but this was my visit here. I knew they have a Happy Hour that pretty much lasts all day, so it made our decision easy. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty empty, but filled up while we were there. I took quite a while perusing the menu. The entire menu is half price during Happy Hour I decided on bento box since it seemed like the best value. My fella ordered some rolls and appetizer as did our friend. My other friend decided on a bento box as well. \n\nOur food came quickly. The portions were large and I was happy with most of the cooked things in my bento box. The katsu was pretty good and not overcooked, the salad was pretty fresh as well. My fella didn't enjoy his rolls so I ended up trading a majority of my bento box for his roll since I liked it better than he did. The spicy tuna was spicy but not as fresh and fell apart quite easily. The sashimi was not fresh at all. The flavor was really fishy and I ended up not eating this portion of my meal. My friends and fella were pretty meh about the dining experience as well. The prices were right, but I don't think I'll be back to this Kobe location.",0
Great for brunch or lunch...\nAmerican style diner...\nHuge burger challenge!,1
"I've been here once, after hearing friends rave about this place. The line was long, but on Black Friday, not a surprise. When it was finally my turn to order, the staff was helpful and explained to me what a \""""flat white\"""" is. I went with a cappucino and a peach tart. The cappucino looked pretty but tasted burnt. The tart was tasteless, unfortunately. It seems clean and the atmosphere is nice but the coffee makes me want to go somewhere else.",0
"I heard good things about this restaurant and had wanted to try it since it always seemed busy. I went on a slow night and thought it would be a perfect time.  Unfortunately, there was nothing noteworthy. Service was very slow and food was extremely bland - and adding salt didn't help. There were no rich flavors or unique items. The margaritas were too sweet ( as was the salsa ) and you couldn't taste the tequila. The only thing that had some flair was the decor.  Overall, it was very disappointing.",0
"Had a very  bad experience here.\n\nFirst off, many of the photos posted on Yelp don't actually exist on the menu. They are from some catering company which you will not be able to order from.\n\nWe ended up getting a wrap, Thai ribs and  a chicken salad.\n\nThe food was all tasteless and bland. I wanted to ask for my money back and walk out. However the group that I was with felt very awkward doing that but they agreed. \n\nI will never be back to this place. Very disappointed in this place because I wanted to try for such a long time.",0
"Ugh. Does anyone really think this is even BBQ? Its more like roasted meat with sauce poured over it. \nAbsolutely the WORST BBQ I've ever had. That \""""Guy\"""" dude must be smoking crack or getting paid off. Seriously.  The service was fine but the food was just horrible.",0
"Disappointing....we brought our kids in with another family on a Tuesday night.  We sat outside and the weather was nice.  It wasn't very busy, but for some reason our food took almost an hour I come and when it did, it was good but that might also be because I was starving.  I frankly expected more at least in service, the waitress was nice but we had to ask for more water, and just felt like we go forgotten.  Not sure if I will be in a hurry to come back...",0
I love this place I could and almost do eat there every day. The fresh steak salad is the healthiest choice out there!,1
"I have had hit and miss service at various Grand Cafes but based on my latest visit, the one at Texas Station gets 4 stars. It was getting late in the day in the office and I was hungry. I had a craving for corned beef hash. So before I left I turned to Yelp to find a place with good hash. Unfortunately all the good breakfast diners close right after lunch. I thought I would be stuck with canned hash fried at home. No bueno. Then on the way home I remembered Texas Station and the Grand Cafe. I checked the menu before being seated just to make sure that had what I wanted. They did. For $7.99 I got a big pile of hash fried to slightly crispy, a pile of hash browns also fried to crispy, three eggs cooked my way (over easy), and a couple pieces of wheat toast. Was it the best hash I've had? No. But it was good and I did not have to fix it. The staff was great. Friendly. Attentive. Quick. I got a good filling meal for an okay price. That works for me.",1
Had a ribeye steak last week.  It was horrible and cost 70 dollars.  I've had better steak at Sizzler.,0
"Raku is my absolute favorite izakaya. I have been coming here for few years. It's time to write a review. \n\nService: Depending upon the server, some servers are bit snobby which I did not care for at all. Sometimes I get lucky and get the better service. Also, I don't like the fact that they give you time limit. This is not ayce!!!I understand they are very busy and need their tables  turnover but I just not a fan. I went few days ago, I think the server told us it's time for our last call after 1.5 hours or earlier. Those are the reasons I didn't give 5 stars. \n\nFood: I love their food. Five star on their food. Here are some of my favorite:\n\n1. Uni with mountain potato, poached egg and salmon roe. I love love love this dish. For some reason, the combination of those items together along with the sauce in there makes this dish so heavenly. \n\n2. Raku homemade tofu: If you like tofu, then you would love their homemade tofu. I like to eat it with their green tea sea salt along with all the condiments that comes with it. \n\n3. Hamachi Kama: They have the best hamachi kama in town. They are like 3 times bigger than the regular hamachi kama you order in other places but also 3 times the price. It's around 45 dollars. I think it's worth it, if you have party of three at least. Otherwise it might be too big for two people. \n\n4. Pork cheek yakitori: I normally don't like pork but their pork cheeks are so juicy and yummy! \n\n5, Juicy Fried chicken: One of my favorite fried chicken. They rolled up the chicken thigh and fried it. Yum yum yum! \n\n6. Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic/ Kobe beef fillet fresh wasabi: I like both of these. They are both very tender and juicy. \n\nThese are my must ordered items every time. As far as for their sashimi, I think they are pretty good for the most part. I had the not so fresh sashimi before though. \n\nEven though it's hard to get reservation and with the snobby service, I will continue to come and try other items because I love their food so much",1

"We always eat here when we crave Saigon Pho. Today was the last we eat here. Here's why .\n\nWe ate with 2 other families. One of the families got their order wrong. Instead of apologizing,  the server kept pointing at the menu telling them that they got what they ordered. Then, my friend found a dead fly in his food. Disappointed friend talked to another  server about it. You know what the server said instead of simply apologizing?  She said \""""you sit by the door so the fly must have gotten in and on your food.\"""" My friend's wife said that the fly was already under the food.  Server replied, \""""no, no, no, no!\"""" She should have just apoligized so they could have moved on. They even had the audacity to charge them for the plate with the dead fly. My friends paid for it anyways. I could tell that they were trying to get rid of us. The other server gave our check even though we were still eating. He kept coming back for it thinking I would put my card on the bill. Later,  I see a server putting a shaved ice desert on our table. We didn't accept it. My friend said the damage has been done. All they needed was an apology,  but instead, the rude server kept on with her attitude.  Finally, the couple asked for the number of their manager. Rude server was upset. These people need to learn about customer service and ethics. I never make reviews.  When I do, it's  something everyone has to know about.",0
"As I walked in to place my order I noticed gnats flying around the register (OK GROSS! I should've walked out then), the woman that took my order was very rude (sighing, rolling eyes, etc), my order was wrong and I was charged for something I did not receive. \n\nIf you really want to try Samurai Sam's I would NOT try this location.",0
"In my opinion I thought this place would have been a little more interesting. It was just a shop full of items to buy that were pretty pricey. If you're a huge fan of M&Ms and want some M&M accessories then maybe you should go here. I'm not a huge fan of M&Ms though, so I wouldn't really want to waste my time here. I think the place is pretty cool how it's fully M&M themed and they also let you watch a free 10 minute movie. It's pretty cute how the kids react to it! :) But yeah I wouldn't recommend this place as a tourist attraction.",0
Used to be my favorite pizza and sub shop but has really gone down hill the past year or so.  Many have mentioned how their recent visits have been dissapointing.,0
"This gym has gone to hell in the last year or so. I don't know if it is managment or corporate or what. It is not as clean as it used to be, I feel dirtier after leaving the locker room than when I went in. Paper towels? Soap? Dream on... I used to see cleaning people every day. Now maybe once or twice a week. The front desk staff seems like they would rather be getting a root canal than actually helping members. Equipment is \""""being repaired\"""" for weeks at a time. Unacceptable. Inconsiderate members don't re-rack weights, fine but then Gold's should have employees working the floor cleaning up after them. But no, they usually only have one employee at the desk and they can't go out from behind it. This is Scottsdale, people expect more. I know two people who have quit recently and I have one foot out the door......",0
"I've stayed here on multiple occasion for EDC and other Vegas trips because you get the most real estate for your money. Usually we get two beds and the pull out coach can fit 2 people or 3 if you're really cozy. It is newer than The Venetian and it's a great place to pre-party with a large group of people. This last time, we got two joint rooms and it was amazing.\n\nPrice wise it is on the mid range+ size but like I said it's worth the real estate. Casinos down stairs are known to be on the higher minimum bet and you definitely want to get a players card if you play because they are known to give out comp rooms from time to time.\n\nLocation wise, this hotel is great because all the hottest clubs are on the North end and you'll have no problem getting around. You can even walk if you want. Also if it's late at night, their food court is always available.",1
Very friendly staff sometimes the have wines tasting with a friendly and knowledge staff \nI use to shop at  others store now I'm a smiths costumer ....\nThanks,1
"Food was good, butttt.... I had to beg for a booth with my 3person party, one being a very important person. I've spent tons of money at the casino so my dinner was comped but I didn't think that justified getting cheap service. It wasn't even that busy but for some reason, the busser/food runner was in charge of our table. She must've been training and wanted to make a good impression because she offered her phone number. She was cute but it turned out to be a joke. Like I said, only to impress. I know customer service is important but coercing a guest, with personal information seems wrong. Especially if it was a joke. Maybe just me but communication seems to be a problem. No wonder Mari needed to make a good impression. Strange that I would get notified of a complaint from an employee later on from management. I still left a huge tip even though the food comp comes from losing tons of money there...the only comp stratatoshpere offers for locals, which is really lame for vegas.",0
"When it comes to the finishing result, I am 100% satisfied with my new cut and the service I received from the stylist, Keturah.   I found out about this place through Yelp, and after weighing out the previous reviews between the good and bad, I decided to give it a gamble.   I was a walk-in, but was accepted warmly.   All the stylist were occupied with clients so I only waited about 10 mins tops till I was pulled for shampooing.   I came prepared with a few photos on my phone as to what I wanted for my hair and discussed it with Keturah.   I originally had short shoulder length hair when I came in and was anticipating a bob-like cut.   She spent a good 2 hrs total on the hair,  a lot of time to detailing with the natural fall.   In the past most hair dressers would rush it, but her technique suited the needs of my Asian hair.  About an hour into it, the place started to pick up but she stayed focus.   She had to leave me a few times to answer the phone or wash another clients hair.  I am assuming she was the salons makane/starter....but her work is professional.  4 years ago I would fly back home to Cali just for hair cuts from my previous dresser....that's how particular I can be.   My advice for those who want to try this place out and those previous comments with bad experiences who want to give it another go; is to go prepared with a few photos of what you want.  Even though their profession is hair, they can't read your mind.   Also, do to my previous cut, she was able to show me parts of my hair to trim and not cut the next time around.   I will be returning to her for sure!  $30 for quality cuts that I usually pay $80-$90 for, I was beyond impressed!",1
My new favorite Mexican restaurant since my old one unexpectedly closed down a few months ago. Little did I know there was another within 10 minutes from my home. Happy hour is insane. The margaritas are amazing and everything we ate was delicious. The restaurant is beautiful and staff is very nice which I didn't expect because of the area. The only downside is that it doesn't feel like its very authentic.  My husband and I are still going to be regulars for sure.,1
"My wife and I are foodies and having relocated from HK to here we are in constant search of all of our \""""favorites\"""" from asia.  Being that we would take food vacations to taipei we walked into Yi Mei with some trepidation.\n\nNow before I continue on, I do want to mention that HK is not actually a great place for taiwanese food (or else we wouldnt go on foodie trips to taipei).\n\nWe ordered the spicy beef noodle soup.  Had a little bit of heat but not sweating sort of spicy.  Which was great because it had a great taste that would've been covered up had it been too spicy.  Very nice!  It was also quite big, I am used to the little paper bowls of beef noodle soup in the alleyways of taiwan, not the american sized portions.  Couldnt finish it all and the waitress (the owners grand daughter) was great and brought me 2 containers 1 for the soup the other for the noodles so it wouldnt go all soggy together.  \n\nMy wife ordered the steamed pork rice.  I knew it was good as soon as she declared \""""I'm not sharing!\""""  Of course she did and it was very good we were impressed. \n\nMy wife had the cold soy milk and enjoyed it I ordered the hot and had to put sugar in it, home made and nice. everything was home made and it was like having a personal taiwanese grandma cooking for us.\n\nThen onto the Xiao Lum Bao.  the filling was good the skin a little thick and not enough \""""soup\"""" inside the dumpling.  These took awhile but they were by far the best I have had in the USA.  Din Tai Fun sets a very high bar,we have gone to the DTF in taipei, shenzen, hong kong, singapore and jakarta (no pork at DTF in jakarta no pork dumplings suck).\n\nGreat food, nice family atmosphere place.

"WHAT A NIGHTMARE WE HAD AS TIME SHARE OWNERS of  Scottsdale Villa Mirage, formerly Sunterra!  We were delighted to finally get rid of this property - donated it to a charity.  \n\nWhat led us to purchase this timeshare was an ambush in Sedona by a Sunterra salesman who invited us to a sales presentation.  The timeshare seemed like a great purchase at first, but later we found it to be second rate.  The furnishings and amenities are not quality.  Not a resort feel, more like an apartment complex.\n\nThe biggest irritation we had with Sunterra was the constant pressure to get us to attend another presentation, promoted as an 'update'.  Each and every visit was the same deal, pressure to attend...BUY, BUY, BUY was Sunterra's cry.  Their salesmen never let up on trying to get us to buy more time.  They even called on Christmas Day. \n\nBeware of purchasing any timeshare. When you decide to sell you'll only get a fraction of what you paid, if you can sell it all.\n\nSo glad to be done with Sunterra/Diamond Resorts.  And GOOD RIDDANCE!",0
When I came to this location only one girl was working window and front. I literally waited 10min to even get an order and while I was ordering she was trying to make a milkshake and get drinks for the drive thru. I felt bad for her I could tell she was stressed so I bit my tongue. But sadly they messed up my order too. I wanted the new 6 burger with the homemade bun but instead I got the regular bun. Which is the whole reason I went there was to try it. I then had to wait another 10 min for them to get me a new burger. \n\nTip to management: you are running your floor thin and understaffed. You may not have a lot of hours to use cause of a slow location. But experience of customers is key. Plus over working your employees! Get someone else in there to help with the windows so the people who do choose to come in and enjoy your service can actually enjoy it!!!,0
"Finally got the chance to see what allll the hype is about and honestly I don't get it. We arrived at about 8pm and I was pissed that my bf took me here when I saw how long the line was. It was very very very long but it went fairly quickly. Total wait time was probably 40 minutes. I think it's weird how you get your first drink while your waiting in line to pay and be seated. Then when you are dining a server brings you all your refills. I think if they removed the soda station in the front the line would move A lot faster! Price is $11.79pp for adults plus $1.99 for a drink so it comes to about $15pp. Kids are cheaper and seniors get like $0.50 off whoop dee doo. Lol\n\nIt was VERY crowded in there and I felt a little claustrophobic trying to fight my way through the crowd to get to and from my table. The buffet is pretty small and the food was just OK some items better than others. I enjoyed the meatloaf it was really good and the fried chicken was decent. Mac and cheese not good tasted like tv dinner mac n cheese. The salad bar was quite big and fresh with lots of toppings including real bacon and chunks of chicken. They also had pizza, spaghetti, chili, potatoes, rolls, some veggies, fried catfish and popcorn shrimp, a few Mexican items like enchiladas and taco meat for tacos and some Chinese items like orange chicken and fried rice. They also had made to order steaks which was probably the best thing they had in the whole restaurant but that was about the extent of it.\n\nAfter I was done with the food I went and waited in line for dessert. They had a few different puddings and cakes on one side and the 3 dessert fountains on the other side where mostly everyone was waiting. I dipped some fruit and marshmallows in the chocolate and caramel sauces and they were pretty good. They also have cotton candy and ice cream. \n\nI'm glad I tried this place but unfortunately I don't think I will be back. With how many other buffets are in this town I feel the selection was lacking for the price and it was just too crowded. I say 2 stars because the servers were really friendly and always on top of clearing plate and refilling drinks and the dessert fountains were pretty good also.",0
"This is the longest rental car line I've ever been in. Dollar should notice how many reservations they have, take into account how slowly their agents rent people cars, and then make sure they have hired enough agents. By the way, all the other rental car companies have barely anybody in line. In all it took over 2 hours to rent a car and involved 3 long lines.  The first line was along line to board the shuttle to the rental car center.  Then, I waited in the longest line of all at the rental car center. Finally, when I go to the rental car lot, there was a long line.  OK, there was actually a 4th line, but it was not as bad as the other 3.  It was a line at the parking exit, where the attendant checked to make sure I wasn't stealing their car.\n\nBefore you rent any car in Vegas, I recommend thinking about whether you really need the car.  You can get to and from the airport much more quickly by Taxi, and in the long run it's cheaper.  If all you're going to do is hang out on the Strip, you probably don't need to rent a car, just so you can keep it in the hotel garage the whole time.  By the way, the only reason I rented a car was because I needed it to go out of town.",0
First time there. I checked in and got the cheeseburger combo. Very generous portions! I couldn't eat it all. The cheeseburger was delicious! Really big patty with generous toppings and the bun Is not a typical hamburger bun. It was much bigger. It was more like a roll. I had the zucchini sticks instead of fries. They were really big and thick cut but lacked flavor. Overall I was very pleased but I don't think I will order the zucchini again.,1
"Horrible customer service.  The snobby girl at the register does not greet you, does not state the price of your order, and does not reply to hello or thank you. She just holds out her hand for cash.",0
"Their guacamole is the best I've ever had. Their tacos are really good too. A little bit on the pricy side but definitely worth it. They have a 2pm-6pm happy hour where their tacos are 1$ off, good deal!",1
only went there after 4am and the was ridulous! thats wassup!,1
Still five stars!  The vet actually called me the next day to see how my kitty was doing.  A++++++++++++++,1
Excellent food. I loved the kadai chicken and malai kofta. Hostess offered us complimentary rice which was nice of her.\nWould prefer to have the servers dressed a bit professionally rather than street clothes.,1
"It's not down-home BBQ; hell, it's not even GOOD BBQ. However, if you have more money than taste, Bobby Q will suit you just fine (doucher-heaven). Apparently this is not a national chain, but they sure did make it look, taste, and act like one. The waitress sounded like a sad, embarrassed corporate robot giving us a memorized recitation about their aged beef stash and some special \""""gourmet\"""" appetizer that is actually just a taquito (yawn). The chicken and pulled-pork were both CHEWY, not tender, and the pork is FATTY (CHUNKS-O-FAT) and had to be picked through. The sauce on the chicken is an ABOMINATION and shouldn't even be referred to as BBQ SAUCE. PORTIONS ARE SMALL! The corn bread is DAMP with greasy vegetable oil and falls apart in your hand. An old, dusty flap of kale was laid on the plate for a garnish. Many reviewers mention the tiny, OIL-SOAKED, mini-donuts that the hostesses are making (as a side job/not much training) by the door on the way out as something that really impressed them. How drunk must they have been at that point? It's just depressing to even think about really...A place better forgotten...",0
I have gone to this place two days in a row for lunch and tomorrow I will probably make it three. I had the chicken and onion rings the first time and the chicken and waffles the second. It was only $7 with a drink in both cases. The chicken has a nice crunch and flavor on the outside and is moist and hot on the inside. Can't wait to try the beignets!,1
"This location hires the best people! I have been there twice this month and the employess are very helpful and friendly!\n\nOh, yes, and the chocolate here is amazing!!",1
Went to this restaurant today. I found a fly in my chicken chimi burrito. After that no one wanted to finish there food. I spent 40.00 on this nasty place. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Maybe they should do restaurant impossible to get there place cleaned up so that doesn't happen to anyone else.,0
"We are here and are staying for 5 nights! It is a great hotel and perfect for my kids and I! We have never been here before so there is something I wish I knew! The m life card gets you discounts! So I thought this card comes in the mail and I missed out on having it, but a lady just told me that you go get it in the casino and I should have been showing everyone it! I have already spent like $2000 without it! Make sure you pick that card up! Besides the lack of knowledge of just being a new visitor it's a great place! The lazy river is amazing! My daughter is allergic to the pool right on this property, not sure what the difference is but something!\n\nI don't have my receipts but I know for next time!",1
I wish they carried fashion for real sized women. You know over a size 8. The seamstress Ava is fantastic!,0
"Pathetic use to be a good place to get the car washed, paid for their \""""VIP package\"""" and they didn't vacuum an inch of the car, Not the console, back seats or trunk. didn't dress the interior or even put the air freshener in.  Then use the same black greasy tire rag on my door handles, side panels & interior( exterior is candy white & interior is beige) now my interior has this awesome black grease stain in the back seats,even though I've had passangers in the back 3 times at the most. To make it worse after I got home I had to polish the interior my self, I noticed THEY BROKE my passenger window button, even though there was still crumbs and trash in that area. By far the worse place ever. Took over an hour and it wasn't even busy nor did they do a Damn thing they had been paid for. Bring back all the Hispanic people,they did a way better job. NEVER bring you're car to this joke of a business. Take you're car to los olivos or Tom thumbs fresh market.",0
I love love love my lashes.  I have been to almost every lash longe in vegas and Mia is the absolute best!!!!,1
"Of course since we were in Scotland, we HAD to do a whiskey tasting, and Whiski Rooms did the trick. We dropped in on a busy saturday night, hoping for a little calming effect before our haunted tour, and they made room for us.\n\nOur bartender/server was great- we told him what whisky types we normally like, and he brought out a flight that was similar enough, but that let us try new types of whiskys. Super nice. I cant comment on the food, but, it was definitely a great stop in before our tour!",1
"I stayed at Mandalay Bay July 4th weekend in a 2 bedroom suite.  I got super drunk the day I got on the 3rd, and ordered food to go at around 4 in the morning.  My burger was suppose to be medium well, but when I ate it in my room, my burger was burnt like the desert sun.  It was utterly dry.  I didn't mind to much, since I was drunk, and was supe hungry.  \n\nthe next night, I went back and asked for a plastic fork for my leftovers from the same host from the previouse night.  Her name was Connie, and she refused to give us plastic forks.  She then told my boyfriend and I to order from room service to obtain a fork.  This was unacceptable to me, because who the hell refuses to give a freaking plastic fork?  So, I demanded to talk to her manager Karen.  Karen opened the drawer to the podium, the hostess Connie was in front of and pulled out 2 plastic forks?  I was so dammmmmn upset at the point.  You had them right in the drawer at the podium and rather put up a fight and give customer bad attitude than just open your stupid drawer and give us the plastic forks?  This I do not understand, whatsoever.  It's something small, but when it's something that small the hostess should not have made a problem out of this.\n\nI took the liberty of calling the food and beverage manager, I believe his name is Jason, and filed a complaint.  I do hope that he took this seriously and took appropriate action.  There are plenty of people that are looking for a job, so Connie, you are indeed replaceable.  If you don't want a job that require those particular hours, look elsewhere.\n\nI really wanted to have breakfast at Raffles on my last day here, however  I refused to go back/",0
"I like Carolina Cinema Crown Point. The theater is a little older though, but it gets the job done. Movies are cheaper before 6:00pm then the price goes up. Snack foods are pricey but its like that everywhere. Love that I can put my butter on my popcorn, I'm the \""""Can you fill it half way so I can drench both halves in butter\"""" type of person. The staff is friendly here, and its usually pretty clean. I've never had any issues and I use their loyalty card to get free concessions, and tickets.\n\n\nAlso If you have kids, they offer free summer movies as well!\n\nhttp://www.carolinacinemas.com/charlotte/index.php",1
"I didn't know that they allow smoking inside the casino.  I was grossed out when I went in to meet my girlfriends at Orange Sky restaurant.  I cannot agree more, this place smells like a dirty ashtray.  Too bad, because maybe I would have like to spend some time at the tables.",0
"Dirty tables, soiled floors, and bad food.  According to a dated publication posted on the restaurant's wall,  it was the owner's long time dream to open a restaurant.  The publication shocks me for two reasons: the restaurant is dirty and the food is awful... that doesn't feel dreamy to me.   I ordered the sliders.  The wife ordered a turkey club sandwich.  Safe bets considering this is our first visit.  It was hard to find an open table and that's not because the restaurant was busy (at the top of the lunch hour, we were the only patrons)... we couldn't find a clean table.  I guess the dream didn't factor in employees who would rather drink lattes and watch football games than clean tables and floors.  Then came the food. The sliders were clumsily made, the onion straws were cold,  and the mac n' cheese was unseasoned and bland.  My wife's  sandwich was mediocre and  elementary (in my lazy college days, I made better sandwiches with half the sobriety of the restaurant cooks... granted I'm making a big assumption). In short, save your money and spare yourself the nightmare... find another spot.",0
Good Prices and fresh produce abound!,1
We've always been given huge suites with huge balconies.  I think it is because my SO's is distantly related to one of the most famous politicians in Arizona and shares his last name. They alway remember our name and as soon as they see us coming the valets get our car immediately.  I think I want to move to the Phoenix area because that is how we get treated every in the area.,1
"What a completely negative company!! I think robots run this banking system. (Not the specific branches, but the bank as a whole...).\nI opened a new business account (I recently moved to Las Vegas) and was told that problems might arise in the first 3 months but I was not to worry about fees, ect., because these are to be expected.\nFirst of all, I had a check get lost in the mail so I cancelled it. 3 weeks later it shows up to the branch and it gets bounced back... as it should have. Then I deposited a check at the branch and the next week cancelled that bank account (this was my fault... I jumped the gun - not even realizing the check was still out there...\nI went to use my Wells Fargo card and it got declined. I called customer service (misinformation and no real help) and then I went into the branch and was told that they had cancelled all of my cards and closed my accounts.\n\""""Loss Prevention\"""" said that I could not get my money out of my account for 2 weeks. When I called Loss Prevention I was greeted with a robot voiced woman that answered with \""""Nope\"""" and \""""Yep\""""... I asked if there was anything I could do to straighten this out and her answer was \""""nope\"""". I asked if I could speak to a supervisor and she said I could but it wouldn't make any difference... I asked if I could get access to the $20K in my account and she said \""""Nope. Not for 10 business days\"""". (Keep in mind I never overdrew my account).\nHuman Error on my part (and the USPS) - Yes.... Human interaction from Wells Fargo - No!",0
"This place was pretty darn good. Its a cash only and the menu is pretty simple, burgers, dogs and fries. The burger reminded me of a backyard bbq and was pretty darn good. My boyfriend had the triple and a dog (he's got a large appetite) and couldn't quite finish it all.... but don't be mistaken, you will get spankings if you don't finish your food  !! The decor is pretty corny but it was a great time.  If your down with the grease and love a little entertainment Vegas style... this place is for you!",1
"Wow, surprised to see all the lousy reviews of Lucille's here. I lived in SoCal for many years and was always a fan of the place, so I was rather stoked when I heard they were opening one here. Now, granted, it's not authentic in a Kansas City or Memphis kinda way, but I have to differ with the poster who opined that Famous Dave's is better....I'm sorry, but ol' Dave can't touch their ribs. \n\nSure, there are some clunkers on the menu, but I've probably eaten at one Lucille's or another more than a dozen times and I've rarely left unhappy. The up-side to being absolutely bombarded with food is that there's bound to be something good on the plate. \n\nIt's true, if you order the platters you will receive a plate the size of a small child, and weighing almost as much....makes you feel sorry for the waiters, who must get some serious bicep action. Yes, the short ribs suck, but the St Louis style are truly yummy. Burnt fries...? My daughter orders them every time and I've never seen it. The beans? Awesome. Don't know about the strawberry lemonade, but I go for the regular, and it's sweet but quite good. Pricey? Absolutely....not an every-week kind of place.\n\nIf I was a lightweight city kid or someone from suburbia, I'd have read the other reviews and thought \""""gee, am I that clueless about BBQ?\"""" But no, I've lived in the south, I've traveled the US and much of the world...I do know good food. So while I don't want to bicker with my fellow Yelpsters (love y'all), I must agree to disagree with you on this one....Lucille's rawks. And BTW....if you plan on wandering around the Marketplace, eat dinner last, and take home the leftovers. (And for the record, I don't know anyone who's ever had room for dessert....)",1
So much fun!!  The bartender was great!  Adult Cookies and Milk--what could be better?,1
Great shop! Watched them make their waffle comes right in the shop and they are delish!\n\nTried the salted caramel and was surprised to find little chocolate covered caramels inside! Yum!,1
".99 tacos, chicken and beef, and other delicious specials on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Food is great, prepared well and great portions. Great seasonings and plenty of toppings and fillings. Great menu, good price, good service. Loved it! Thanks yelp for suggesting a great little find!",1
I love this location but the inside was crowded and other customers bumped me as they walked by. I'm used to the Baristas asking for my name after I place an order and this time they didn't ask for my name and someone almost walked off with my drink. Oh~~ hell nah!,0
